# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light. 

<sup>3</sup> Indeed, He keeps turning His hand against me all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones. 

<sup>5</sup> He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. 

<sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages. 

<sup>7</sup> He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains. 

<sup>8</sup> Even when I cry out and plead for help, He shuts out my prayer. 

<sup>9</sup> He has barred my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked. 

<sup>10</sup> He is a bear lying in wait, a lion hiding in ambush. 

<sup>11</sup> He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces; He left me without help. 

<sup>12</sup> He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow. 

<sup>13</sup> He pierced my kidneys with His arrows. 

<sup>14</sup> I am a laughingstock to all my people; they mock me in song all day long. 

<sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness; He has intoxicated me with wormwood. 

<sup>16</sup> He has ground my teeth with gravel and trampled me in the dust. 

<sup>17</sup> My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is. 

<sup>18</sup> So I say, “My strength has perished, along with my hope from the LORD.” 

<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall. 

<sup>20</sup> Surely my soul remembers and is humbled within me. 

<sup>21</sup> Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope: 

<sup>22</sup> Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail. 

<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness! 

<sup>24</sup> “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in Him.” 

<sup>25</sup> The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him. 

<sup>26</sup> It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young. 

<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone in silence, for God has disciplined him. 

<sup>29</sup> Let him bury his face in the dust— perhaps there is still hope. 

<sup>30</sup> Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with reproach. 

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast us off forever. 

<sup>32</sup> Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion. 

<sup>33</sup> For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men. 

<sup>34</sup> To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land, 

<sup>35</sup> to deny a man justice before the Most High, 

<sup>36</sup> to subvert a man in his lawsuit— of these the Lord does not approve. 

<sup>37</sup> Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it? 

<sup>38</sup> Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High? 

<sup>39</sup> Why should any mortal man complain, in view of his sins? 

<sup>40</sup> Let us examine and test our ways, and turn back to the LORD. 

<sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven: 

<sup>42</sup> “We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.” 

<sup>43</sup> You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without pity. 

<sup>44</sup> You have covered Yourself with a cloud that no prayer can pass through. 

<sup>45</sup> You have made us scum and refuse among the nations. 

<sup>46</sup> All our enemies open their mouths against us. 

<sup>47</sup> Panic and pitfall have come upon us— devastation and destruction. 

<sup>48</sup> Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief, 

<sup>50</sup> until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees. 

<sup>51</sup> My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city. 

<sup>52</sup> Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird. 

<sup>53</sup> They dropped me alive into a pit and cast stones upon me. 

<sup>54</sup> The waters flowed over my head, and I thought I was going to die. 

<sup>55</sup> I called on Your name, O LORD, out of the depths of the Pit. 

<sup>56</sup> You heard my plea: “Do not ignore my cry for relief.” 

<sup>57</sup> You drew near when I called on You; You said, “Do not be afraid.” 

<sup>58</sup> You defend my cause, O Lord; You redeem my life. 

<sup>59</sup> You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me; vindicate my cause! 

<sup>60</sup> You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me. 

<sup>61</sup> O LORD, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me— 

<sup>62</sup> the slander and murmuring of my assailants against me all day long. 

<sup>63</sup> When they sit and when they rise, see how they mock me in song. 

<sup>64</sup> You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> Put a veil of anguish over their hearts; may Your curse be upon them! 

<sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them from under Your heavens, O LORD.
