# Chapter 3

## The Prophet’s Afflictions

**¹** I [^2987] am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath.

**²** He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light.

**³** Indeed, He keeps turning His hand against me all day long.

**⁴** He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones.

**⁵** He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.

**⁶** He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages.

**⁷** He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains.

**⁸** Even when I cry out and plead for help, He shuts out my prayer.

**⁹** He has barred my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked.

**¹⁰** He is a bear lying in wait, a lion hiding in ambush.

**¹¹** He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces; He left me without help.

**¹²** He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow.

**¹³** He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.

**¹⁴** I am a laughingstock to all my people; they mock me in song all day long.

**¹⁵** He has filled me with bitterness; He has intoxicated me with wormwood.

**¹⁶** He has ground my teeth with gravel and trampled me in the dust.

**¹⁷** My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.

**¹⁸** So I say, “My strength has perished, along with my hope from the LORD.”

## The Prophet’s Hope

**¹⁹** Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall.

**²⁰** Surely my soul remembers and is humbled within me.

**²¹** Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope:

**²²** Because of the loving devotion [^2988] of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail.

**²³** They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!

**²⁴** “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in Him.”

**²⁵** The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.

**²⁶** It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.

**²⁷** It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young.

**²⁸** Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it upon him.

**²⁹** Let him bury his face in the dust— perhaps there is still hope.

**³⁰** Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with reproach.

**³¹** For the Lord will not cast us off forever.

**³²** Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion.

**³³** For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men.

**³⁴** To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,

**³⁵** to deny a man justice before the Most High,

**³⁶** to subvert a man in his lawsuit— of these the Lord does not approve.

## God’s Justice

**³⁷** Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?

**³⁸** Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?

**³⁹** Why should any mortal man complain, in view of his sins?

**⁴⁰** Let us examine and test our ways, and turn back to the LORD.

**⁴¹** Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:

**⁴²** “We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.”

**⁴³** You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without pity.

**⁴⁴** You have covered Yourself with a cloud that no prayer can pass through.

**⁴⁵** You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.

**⁴⁶** All our enemies open their mouths against us.

**⁴⁷** Panic and pitfall have come upon us— devastation and destruction.

**⁴⁸** Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people.

**⁴⁹** My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief,

**⁵⁰** until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.

**⁵¹** My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.

**⁵²** Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird.

**⁵³** They dropped me alive into a pit and cast stones upon me.

**⁵⁴** The waters flowed over my head, and I thought I was going to die.

**⁵⁵** I called on Your name, O LORD, out of the depths of the Pit.

**⁵⁶** You heard my plea: “Do not ignore my cry for relief.”

**⁵⁷** You drew near when I called on You; You said, “Do not be afraid.”

**⁵⁸** You defend my cause, O Lord; You redeem my life.

**⁵⁹** You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me; vindicate my cause!

**⁶⁰** You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.

**⁶¹** O LORD, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me—

**⁶²** the slander and murmuring of my assailants against me all day long.

**⁶³** When they sit and when they rise, see how they mock me in song.

**⁶⁴** You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.

**⁶⁵** Put a veil of anguish over their hearts; may Your curse be upon them!

**⁶⁶** You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them from under Your heavens, O LORD.
