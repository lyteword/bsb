# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us. Look and see our disgrace! 

<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners. 

<sup>3</sup> We have become fatherless orphans; our mothers are widows. 

<sup>4</sup> We must buy the water we drink; our wood comes at a price. 

<sup>5</sup> We are closely pursued; we are weary and find no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned and are no more, but we bear their punishment. 

<sup>8</sup> Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hands. 

<sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> Our skin is as hot as an oven with fever from our hunger. 

<sup>11</sup> Women have been ravished in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders receive no respect. 

<sup>13</sup> Young men toil at millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood. 

<sup>14</sup> The elders have left the city gate; the young men have stopped their music. 

<sup>15</sup> Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning. 

<sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

<sup>17</sup> Because of this, our hearts are faint; because of these, our eyes grow dimâ€” 

<sup>18</sup> because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, patrolled by foxes. 

<sup>19</sup> You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation. 

<sup>20</sup> Why have You forgotten us forever? Why have You forsaken us for so long? 

<sup>21</sup> Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, so we may return; renew our days as of old, 

<sup>22</sup> unless You have utterly rejected us and remain angry with us beyond measure.
