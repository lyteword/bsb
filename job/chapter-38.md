# Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: 

<sup>2</sup> “Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge? 

<sup>3</sup> Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me. 

<sup>4</sup> Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding. 

<sup>5</sup> Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched a measuring line across it? 

<sup>6</sup> On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone, 

<sup>7</sup> while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

<sup>8</sup> Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, 

<sup>9</sup> when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket, 

<sup>10</sup> when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors, 

<sup>11</sup> and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther; here your proud waves must stop’? 

<sup>12</sup> In your days, have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place, 

<sup>13</sup> that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it? 

<sup>14</sup> The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment. 

<sup>15</sup> Light is withheld from the wicked, and their upraised arm is broken. 

<sup>16</sup> Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep? 

<sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? 

<sup>18</sup> Have you surveyed the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this. 

<sup>19</sup> Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides, 

<sup>20</sup> so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home? 

<sup>21</sup> Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great! 

<sup>22</sup> Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail, 

<sup>23</sup> which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of war and battle? 

<sup>24</sup> In which direction is the lightning dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth? 

<sup>25</sup> Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt, 

<sup>26</sup> to bring rain on a barren land, on a desert where no man lives, 

<sup>27</sup> to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass? 

<sup>28</sup> Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew? 

<sup>29</sup> From whose womb does the ice emerge? Who gives birth to the frost from heaven, 

<sup>30</sup> when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen? 

<sup>31</sup> Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion? 

<sup>32</sup> Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear and her cubs? 

<sup>33</sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth? 

<sup>34</sup> Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you? 

<sup>35</sup> Can you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’? 

<sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the heart or given understanding to the mind? 

<sup>37</sup> Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens 

<sup>38</sup> when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together? 

<sup>39</sup> Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions 

<sup>40</sup> when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket? 

<sup>41</sup> Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food?
