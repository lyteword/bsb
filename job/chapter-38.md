# Chapter 38

## The LORD Challenges Job

**¹** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:

**²** “Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge?[^2118]

**³** Now brace yourself [^2119] like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.[^2120]

**⁴** Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding.

**⁵** Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched a measuring line across it?

**⁶** On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone,[^2121]

**⁷** while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

**⁸** Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,

**⁹** when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,

**¹⁰** when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors,

**¹¹** and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther; here your proud waves must stop’?

**¹²** In your days, have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,

**¹³** that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?

**¹⁴** The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.

**¹⁵** Light is withheld from the wicked, and their upraised arm is broken.

**¹⁶** Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep?

**¹⁷** Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?

**¹⁸** Have you surveyed the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.

**¹⁹** Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides,

**²⁰** so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home?

**²¹** Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great!

**²²** Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail,

**²³** which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of war and battle?

**²⁴** In which direction is the lightning dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?

**²⁵** Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt,

**²⁶** to bring rain on a barren land, on a desert where no man lives,

**²⁷** to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass?

**²⁸** Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?

**²⁹** From whose womb does the ice emerge? Who gives birth to the frost from heaven,

**³⁰** when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen?

**³¹** Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?

**³²** Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons [^2122] or lead out the Bear [^2123] and her cubs?

**³³** Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?

**³⁴** Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?

**³⁵** Can you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?

**³⁶** Who has put wisdom in the heart [^2124] or given understanding to the mind?

**³⁷** Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens

**³⁸** when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together?

**³⁹** Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions

**⁴⁰** when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket?

**⁴¹** Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food?
