## Bildad: God Punishes the Wicked

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

<sup>2</sup> “How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.

<sup>3</sup> Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?

<sup>4</sup> You who tear yourself in anger— should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?

<sup>5</sup> Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.

<sup>6</sup> The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.

<sup>7</sup> His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.

<sup>8</sup> For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.

<sup>9</sup> A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.

<sup>10</sup> A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.

<sup>11</sup> Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.

<sup>12</sup> His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.

<sup>13</sup> It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.

<sup>14</sup> He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.

<sup>15</sup> Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.

<sup>16</sup> The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.

<sup>17</sup> The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.

<sup>18</sup> He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.

<sup>19</sup> He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.

<sup>20</sup> Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.

<sup>21</sup> Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”
