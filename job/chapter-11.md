# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 

<sup>2</sup> “Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated? 

<sup>3</sup> Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke? 

<sup>4</sup> You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’ 

<sup>5</sup> But if only God would speak and open His lips against you, 

<sup>6</sup> and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves. 

<sup>7</sup> Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty? 

<sup>8</sup> They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know? 

<sup>9</sup> Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him? 

<sup>11</sup> Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note? 

<sup>12</sup> But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man! 

<sup>13</sup> As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him, 

<sup>14</sup> if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents, 

<sup>15</sup> then indeed you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and unafraid. 

<sup>16</sup> For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by. 

<sup>17</sup> Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety. 

<sup>19</sup> You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor. 

<sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”
