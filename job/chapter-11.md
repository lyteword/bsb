# Chapter 11

## Zophar Rebukes Job

**¹** Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:

**²** “Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated?

**³** Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke?

**⁴** You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’

**⁵** But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,

**⁶** and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.

**⁷** Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?

**⁸** They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?

**⁹** Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.

**¹⁰** If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him?

**¹¹** Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?

**¹²** But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man![^2074]

**¹³** As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him,

**¹⁴** if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,

**¹⁵** then indeed you will lift up your face without blemish; you will stand firm and unafraid.

**¹⁶** For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.

**¹⁷** Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.

**¹⁸** You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety.

**¹⁹** You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor.

**²⁰** But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”
