# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> And Job continued his discourse: 

<sup>2</sup> “How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me, 

<sup>3</sup> when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness, 

<sup>4</sup> when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God rested on my tent, 

<sup>5</sup> when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me, 

<sup>6</sup> when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil! 

<sup>7</sup> When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square, 

<sup>8</sup> the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet. 

<sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands. 

<sup>10</sup> The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths. 

<sup>11</sup> For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me, 

<sup>12</sup> because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy. 

<sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban. 

<sup>15</sup> I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame. 

<sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger. 

<sup>17</sup> I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth. 

<sup>18</sup> So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand. 

<sup>19</sup> My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches. 

<sup>20</sup> My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’ 

<sup>21</sup> Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel. 

<sup>22</sup> After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew. 

<sup>23</sup> They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers. 

<sup>24</sup> If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious. 

<sup>25</sup> I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.
