# Chapter 29

## Job’s Former Blessings

**¹** And Job continued his discourse:

**²** “How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,

**³** when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness,

**⁴** when I was in my prime,[^2096] when the friendship of God rested on my tent,

**⁵** when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,

**⁶** when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!

**⁷** When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,

**⁸** the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet.

**⁹** The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.

**¹⁰** The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.

**¹¹** For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me,

**¹²** because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper.

**¹³** The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.

**¹⁴** I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban.

**¹⁵** I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame.

**¹⁶** I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger.

**¹⁷** I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.

**¹⁸** So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand.

**¹⁹** My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.

**²⁰** My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’

**²¹** Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel.

**²²** After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew.

**²³** They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers.

**²⁴** If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious.

**²⁵** I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.

[^2096]: 29:4 Hebrew in the time of my harvest
