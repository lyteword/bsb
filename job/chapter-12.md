## Job Presents His Case

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered:

<sup>2</sup> “Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die!

<sup>3</sup> But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?

<sup>4</sup> I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.

<sup>5</sup> The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.

<sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure— those who carry their god in their hands.[^2075]

<sup>7</sup> But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.

<sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.

<sup>9</sup> Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?

<sup>10</sup> The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.

<sup>11</sup> Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?

<sup>12</sup> Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.

<sup>13</sup> Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.

<sup>14</sup> What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.

<sup>15</sup> If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.

<sup>16</sup> True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.

<sup>17</sup> He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.

<sup>18</sup> He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.

<sup>19</sup> He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.

<sup>20</sup> He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.

<sup>21</sup> He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.

<sup>22</sup> He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.

<sup>23</sup> He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.

<sup>24</sup> He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.

<sup>25</sup> They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.

[^2075]: 12:6 Or though God keeps them in His power
