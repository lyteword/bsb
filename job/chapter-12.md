## Job Presents His Case

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die!

**³** But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?

**⁴** I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.

**⁵** The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.

**⁶** The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure— those who carry their god in their hands.[^2075]

**⁷** But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.

**⁸** Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.

**⁹** Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?

**¹⁰** The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.

**¹¹** Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?

**¹²** Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.

**¹³** Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.

**¹⁴** What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.

**¹⁵** If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.

**¹⁶** True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.

**¹⁷** He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.

**¹⁸** He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.

**¹⁹** He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.

**²⁰** He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.

**²¹** He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.

**²²** He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.

**²³** He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.

**²⁴** He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.

**²⁵** They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.

[^2075]: 12:6 Or though God keeps them in His power
