## Job Prepares for Death

<sup>1</sup> “My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.

<sup>2</sup> Surely mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.

<sup>3</sup> Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?

<sup>4</sup> You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.

<sup>5</sup> If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.

<sup>6</sup> He has made me a byword among the people, a man in whose face they spit.

<sup>7</sup> My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.

<sup>8</sup> The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.

<sup>9</sup> Yet a righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.

<sup>10</sup> But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.

<sup>11</sup> My days have passed; my plans are broken off— even the desires of my heart.

<sup>12</sup> They have turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness.

<sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,

<sup>14</sup> and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’

<sup>15</sup> where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?

<sup>16</sup> Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?”
