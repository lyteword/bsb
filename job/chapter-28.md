# Chapter 28

## Where Can Wisdom Be Found?

**¹** “Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.

**²** Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.

**³** Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.

**⁴** Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways.

**⁵** Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire.

**⁶** Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold.

**⁷** No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.

**⁸** Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it.

**⁹** The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base.

**¹⁰** He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.

**¹¹** He stops up [^2093] the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light.

**¹²** But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell?

**¹³** No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.

**¹⁴** The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’

**¹⁵** It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.

**¹⁶** It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.

**¹⁷** Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.

**¹⁸** Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.

**¹⁹** Topaz from Cush [^2094] cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.

**²⁰** From where, then, does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell?

**²¹** It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air.

**²²** Abaddon [^2095] and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’

**²³** But God understands its way, and He knows its place.

**²⁴** For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.

**²⁵** When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters,

**²⁶** when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt,

**²⁷** then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out.

**²⁸** And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”

[^2093]: 28:11 Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate He searches
[^2094]: 28:19 That is, the upper Nile region
[^2095]: 28:22 Abaddon means Destruction.
