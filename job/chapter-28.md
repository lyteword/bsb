# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> “Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined. 

<sup>2</sup> Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore. 

<sup>3</sup> Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness. 

<sup>4</sup> Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways. 

<sup>5</sup> Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire. 

<sup>6</sup> Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold. 

<sup>7</sup> No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it. 

<sup>8</sup> Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it. 

<sup>9</sup> The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base. 

<sup>10</sup> He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure. 

<sup>11</sup> He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light. 

<sup>12</sup> But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell? 

<sup>13</sup> No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’ 

<sup>15</sup> It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. 

<sup>16</sup> It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire. 

<sup>17</sup> Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it. 

<sup>18</sup> Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. 

<sup>19</sup> Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. 

<sup>20</sup> From where then does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell? 

<sup>21</sup> It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air. 

<sup>22</sup> Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’ 

<sup>23</sup> But God understands its way, and He knows its place. 

<sup>24</sup> For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 

<sup>25</sup> When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters, 

<sup>26</sup> when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt, 

<sup>27</sup> then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out. 

<sup>28</sup> And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
