# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> â€œBut now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to entrust with my sheep dogs. 

<sup>2</sup> What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them? 

<sup>3</sup> Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night. 

<sup>4</sup> They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food. 

<sup>5</sup> They were banished from among men, shouted down like thieves, 

<sup>6</sup> so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles. 

<sup>8</sup> A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land. 

<sup>9</sup> And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them. 

<sup>10</sup> They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. 

<sup>11</sup> Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence. 

<sup>12</sup> The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me. 

<sup>13</sup> They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them. 

<sup>14</sup> They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in. 

<sup>15</sup> Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me. 

<sup>17</sup> Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest. 

<sup>18</sup> With great force He grasps my garment; He seizes me by the collar of my tunic. 

<sup>19</sup> He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes. 

<sup>20</sup> I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me. 

<sup>21</sup> You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand. 

<sup>22</sup> You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about in the storm. 

<sup>23</sup> Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living. 

<sup>24</sup> Yet no one stretches out his hand to a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress. 

<sup>25</sup> Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy? 

<sup>26</sup> But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell. 

<sup>27</sup> I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me. 

<sup>28</sup> I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. 

<sup>29</sup> I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of ostriches. 

<sup>30</sup> My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever. 

<sup>31</sup> My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.
