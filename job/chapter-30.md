# Chapter 30

## Job’s Honor Turned to Contempt

**¹** “But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs.

**²** What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them?

**³** Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night.

**⁴** They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.[^2097]

**⁵** They were banished from among men, shouted at like thieves,

**⁶** so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.

**⁷** They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles.

**⁸** A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land.

**⁹** And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.

**¹⁰** They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.

**¹¹** Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint [^2098] in my presence.

**¹²** The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me.

**¹³** They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them.[^2099]

**¹⁴** They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in.

## Job’s Prosperity Becomes Calamity

**¹⁵** Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.

**¹⁶** And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.

**¹⁷** Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest.

**¹⁸** With great force He grasps my garment;[^2100] He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.

**¹⁹** He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.

**²⁰** I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me.

**²¹** You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand.

**²²** You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about [^2101] in the storm.

**²³** Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.

**²⁴** Yet no one stretches out his hand against a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress.

**²⁵** Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?

**²⁶** But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell.

**²⁷** I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me.

**²⁸** I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.

**²⁹** I have become a brother of jackals,[^2102] a companion of ostriches.[^2103]

**³⁰** My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever.

**³¹** My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.
