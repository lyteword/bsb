# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> “Call out if you please, but who will answer? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 

<sup>2</sup> For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple. 

<sup>3</sup> I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed. 

<sup>4</sup> His sons are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender. 

<sup>5</sup> The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth. 

<sup>6</sup> For distress does not spring from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. 

<sup>8</sup> However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him— 

<sup>9</sup> the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number. 

<sup>10</sup> He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields. 

<sup>11</sup> He sets the lowly on high, so that mourners are lifted to safety. 

<sup>12</sup> He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands find no success. 

<sup>13</sup> He catches the wise in their craftiness, and sweeps away the plans of the cunning. 

<sup>14</sup> They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night. 

<sup>15</sup> He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful. 

<sup>16</sup> So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. 

<sup>18</sup> For He wounds, but He also binds; He strikes, but His hands also heal. 

<sup>19</sup> He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven. 

<sup>20</sup> In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword. 

<sup>21</sup> You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and will not fear havoc when it comes. 

<sup>22</sup> You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth. 

<sup>23</sup> For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you. 

<sup>24</sup> You will know that your tent is secure, and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home. 

<sup>25</sup> You will know that your offspring will be many, your descendants like the grass of the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> You will come to the grave in full vigor, like a sheaf of grain gathered in season. 

<sup>27</sup> Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true! So hear it and know for yourself.”
