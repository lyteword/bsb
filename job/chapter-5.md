## Eliphaz Continues: God Blesses those Who Seek Him

**¹** “Call out if you please, but who will answer? To which of the holy ones will you turn?

**²** For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.

**³** I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.

**⁴** His sons are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.

**⁵** The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.[^2062]

**⁶** For distress does not spring from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.

**⁷** Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.

**⁸** However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him—

**⁹** the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.

**¹⁰** He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields.

**¹¹** He sets the lowly on high, so that mourners are lifted to safety.

**¹²** He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands find no success.

**¹³** He catches the wise in their craftiness,[^2063] and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.

**¹⁴** They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night.

**¹⁵** He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful.

**¹⁶** So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.

**¹⁷** Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.[^2064]

**¹⁸** For He wounds, but He also binds; He strikes, but His hands also heal.

**¹⁹** He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.

**²⁰** In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.

**²¹** You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and will not fear havoc when it comes.

**²²** You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.

**²³** For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.

**²⁴** You will know that your tent is secure, and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.

**²⁵** You will know that your offspring will be many, your descendants like the grass of the earth.

**²⁶** You will come to the grave in full vigor, like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.

**²⁷** Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true! So hear it and know for yourself.”
