## Eliphaz: Job Does Not Fear God

**¹** Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

**²** “Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?

**³** Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?

**⁴** But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.

**⁵** For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.

**⁶** Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.

**⁷** Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?

**⁸** Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?

**⁹** What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?

**¹⁰** Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side— men much older than your father.

**¹¹** Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?

**¹²** Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,[^2079]

**¹³** so that you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?

**¹⁴** What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?

**¹⁵** If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,

**¹⁶** how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?

**¹⁷** Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,

**¹⁸** what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,

**¹⁹** to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.

**²⁰** A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.

**²¹** Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.

**²²** He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.

**²³** He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.

**²⁴** Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.

**²⁵** For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,

**²⁶** rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.

**²⁷** Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,

**²⁸** he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.

**²⁹** He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.

**³⁰** He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.

**³¹** Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.

**³²** It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.

**³³** He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.

**³⁴** For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

**³⁵** They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”
