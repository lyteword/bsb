## Eliphaz: Job Does Not Fear God

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

<sup>2</sup> “Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?

<sup>3</sup> Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?

<sup>4</sup> But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.

<sup>5</sup> For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.

<sup>6</sup> Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.

<sup>7</sup> Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?

<sup>8</sup> Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?

<sup>9</sup> What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?

<sup>10</sup> Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side— men much older than your father.

<sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?

<sup>12</sup> Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,[^2079]

<sup>13</sup> so that you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?

<sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?

<sup>15</sup> If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,

<sup>16</sup> how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?

<sup>17</sup> Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,

<sup>18</sup> what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,

<sup>19</sup> to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.

<sup>20</sup> A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.

<sup>21</sup> Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.

<sup>22</sup> He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.

<sup>23</sup> He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.

<sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.

<sup>25</sup> For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,

<sup>26</sup> rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.

<sup>27</sup> Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,

<sup>28</sup> he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.

<sup>29</sup> He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.

<sup>30</sup> He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.

<sup>31</sup> Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.

<sup>32</sup> It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.

<sup>33</sup> He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.

<sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

<sup>35</sup> They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”
