# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Then Job replied: 

<sup>2</sup> “If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales. 

<sup>3</sup> For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas— no wonder my words have been rash. 

<sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me. 

<sup>5</sup> Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass, or an ox low over its fodder? 

<sup>6</sup> Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg ? 

<sup>7</sup> My soul refuses to touch them; they are loathsome food to me. 

<sup>8</sup> If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope: 

<sup>9</sup> that God would be willing to crush me, to unleash His hand and cut me off! 

<sup>10</sup> It still brings me comfort, and joy through unrelenting pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 

<sup>11</sup> What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient? 

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength like that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze? 

<sup>13</sup> Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me? 

<sup>14</sup> A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 

<sup>15</sup> But my brothers are as faithless as wadis, as seasonal streams that overflow, 

<sup>16</sup> darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow, 

<sup>17</sup> but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat. 

<sup>18</sup> Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish. 

<sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema look for water; the travelers of Sheba hope to find it. 

<sup>20</sup> They are confounded because they had hoped; their arrival brings disappointment. 

<sup>21</sup> For now you are of no help; you see terror, and you are afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> Have I ever said, ‘Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth; 

<sup>23</sup> deliver me from the hand of the enemy; redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’? 

<sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand how I have erred. 

<sup>25</sup> How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove? 

<sup>26</sup> Do you intend to correct my words, and treat as wind my cry of despair? 

<sup>27</sup> You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend. 

<sup>28</sup> But now, please look at me. Would I lie to your face? 

<sup>29</sup> Reconsider; do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake. 

<sup>30</sup> Is there iniquity on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern malice?
