# Chapter 13

## Job Prepares His Case

**¹** “Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.

**²** What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.

**³** Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.

**⁴** You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.

**⁵** If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!

**⁶** Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.

**⁷** Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?

**⁸** Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?

**⁹** Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?

**¹⁰** Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.

**¹¹** Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?

**¹²** Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.

**¹³** Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.

**¹⁴** Why do I put myself at risk [^2076] and take my life in my own hands?

**¹⁵** Though He slay me, I will hope in Him.[^2077] I will still defend my ways to His face.

**¹⁶** Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.

**¹⁷** Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.

**¹⁸** See now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.

**¹⁹** Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.

**²⁰** Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:

**²¹** Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.

**²²** Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.

**²³** How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.

**²⁴** Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?

**²⁵** Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?

**²⁶** For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.

**²⁷** You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.

**²⁸** So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.

[^2076]: 13:14 Literally Why do I take my flesh in my teeth
[^2077]: 13:15 Or I have no other hope
