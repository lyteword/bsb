# Chapter 13

## Job Prepares His Case

<sup>1</sup> “Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.

<sup>2</sup> What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.

<sup>3</sup> Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.

<sup>4</sup> You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.

<sup>5</sup> If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!

<sup>6</sup> Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.

<sup>7</sup> Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?

<sup>8</sup> Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?

<sup>9</sup> Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?

<sup>10</sup> Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.

<sup>11</sup> Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?

<sup>12</sup> Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.

<sup>13</sup> Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.

<sup>14</sup> Why do I put myself at risk [^2076] and take my life in my own hands?

<sup>15</sup> Though He slay me, I will hope in Him.[^2077] I will still defend my ways to His face.

<sup>16</sup> Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.

<sup>17</sup> Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.

<sup>18</sup> See now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.

<sup>19</sup> Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.

<sup>20</sup> Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:

<sup>21</sup> Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.

<sup>22</sup> Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.

<sup>23</sup> How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.

<sup>24</sup> Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?

<sup>25</sup> Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?

<sup>26</sup> For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.

<sup>27</sup> You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.

<sup>28</sup> So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.

[^2076]: 13:14 Literally Why do I take my flesh in my teeth
[^2077]: 13:15 Or I have no other hope
