# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: 

<sup>2</sup> “Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven. 

<sup>3</sup> Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise? 

<sup>4</sup> How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure? 

<sup>5</sup> If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight, 

<sup>6</sup> how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!”
