# Chapter 33

## Elihu Rebukes Job

**¹** “But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.

**²** Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.

**³** My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.

**⁴** The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

**⁵** Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.

**⁶** I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.

**⁷** Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.

**⁸** Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:

**⁹** ‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.

**¹⁰** Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.

**¹¹** He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’

**¹²** Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.

**¹³** Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks? [^2110]

**¹⁴** For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.

**¹⁵** In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,

**¹⁶** He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings

**¹⁷** to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,

**¹⁸** to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.

**¹⁹** A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,

**²⁰** so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.

**²¹** His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.

**²²** He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.

**²³** Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,

**²⁴** to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’

**²⁵** then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.

**²⁶** He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.

**²⁷** Then he sings before [^2111] men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.

**²⁸** He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’

**²⁹** Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,

**³⁰** to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.

**³¹** Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.

**³²** But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.

**³³** But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
