# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> “But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know. 

<sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 

<sup>5</sup> Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me. 

<sup>6</sup> I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay. 

<sup>7</sup> Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you. 

<sup>8</sup> Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words: 

<sup>9</sup> ‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me. 

<sup>10</sup> Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’ 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man. 

<sup>13</sup> Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks? 

<sup>14</sup> For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices. 

<sup>15</sup> In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds, 

<sup>16</sup> He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings 

<sup>17</sup> to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride, 

<sup>18</sup> to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword. 

<sup>19</sup> A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones, 

<sup>20</sup> so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food. 

<sup>21</sup> His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude. 

<sup>22</sup> He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death. 

<sup>23</sup> Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him, 

<sup>24</sup> to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’ 

<sup>25</sup> then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth. 

<sup>26</sup> He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man. 

<sup>27</sup> Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved. 

<sup>28</sup> He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’ 

<sup>29</sup> Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times, 

<sup>30</sup> to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life. 

<sup>31</sup> Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. 

<sup>32</sup> But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you. 

<sup>33</sup> But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
