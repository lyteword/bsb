# Chapter 16

## Job Decries His Comforters

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.

**³** Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?

**⁴** I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.

**⁵** But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.

**⁶** Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?

**⁷** Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.

**⁸** You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.

**⁹** His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.

**¹⁰** They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.

**¹¹** God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.

**¹²** I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;

**¹³** His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.

**¹⁴** He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.

**¹⁵** I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.

**¹⁶** My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;

**¹⁷** yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.

**¹⁸** O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.

**¹⁹** Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.

**²⁰** My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.

**²¹** Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!

**²²** For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.
