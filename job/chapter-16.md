# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> â€œI have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all. 

<sup>3</sup> Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying? 

<sup>4</sup> I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you. 

<sup>5</sup> But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief. 

<sup>6</sup> Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away? 

<sup>7</sup> Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family. 

<sup>8</sup> You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me. 

<sup>9</sup> His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes. 

<sup>10</sup> They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me. 

<sup>11</sup> God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target; 

<sup>13</sup> His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground. 

<sup>14</sup> He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior. 

<sup>15</sup> I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes; 

<sup>17</sup> yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure. 

<sup>18</sup> O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest. 

<sup>19</sup> Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high. 

<sup>20</sup> My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God. 

<sup>21</sup> Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor! 

<sup>22</sup> For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.
