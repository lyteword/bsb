## Job: God Will Punish the Wicked

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me.

**³** Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.

**⁴** Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient?

**⁵** Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth.

**⁶** When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.

**⁷** Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?

**⁸** Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes.

**⁹** Their homes are safe from fear; no rod of punishment from God is upon them.

**¹⁰** Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.

**¹¹** They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about,

**¹²** singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute.

**¹³** They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.[^2086]

**¹⁴** Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways.

**¹⁵** Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’

**¹⁶** Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.

**¹⁷** How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?

**¹⁸** Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm?

**¹⁹** It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.

**²⁰** Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.

**²¹** For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out?

**²²** Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high?

**²³** One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease.

**²⁴** His body is well nourished,[^2087] and his bones are rich with marrow.

**²⁵** Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity.

**²⁶** But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both.

**²⁷** Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.

**²⁸** For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’

**²⁹** Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports?

**³⁰** Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath.

**³¹** Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?

**³²** He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.

**³³** The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number.

**³⁴** So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”

[^2086]: 21:13 Or in an instant
[^2087]: 21:24 Literally His pails are full of milk
