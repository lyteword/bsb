# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> “Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me. 

<sup>3</sup> Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking. 

<sup>4</sup> Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient? 

<sup>5</sup> Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror. 

<sup>7</sup> Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power? 

<sup>8</sup> Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Their homes are safe from fear; no rod of punishment from God is upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry. 

<sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about, 

<sup>12</sup> singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute. 

<sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace. 

<sup>14</sup> Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways. 

<sup>15</sup> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’ 

<sup>16</sup> Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction? 

<sup>18</sup> Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm? 

<sup>19</sup> It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it. 

<sup>20</sup> Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty. 

<sup>21</sup> For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out? 

<sup>22</sup> Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high? 

<sup>23</sup> One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease. 

<sup>24</sup> His body is well nourished, and his bones are rich with marrow. 

<sup>25</sup> Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity. 

<sup>26</sup> But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both. 

<sup>27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me. 

<sup>28</sup> For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’ 

<sup>29</sup> Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports? 

<sup>30</sup> Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath. 

<sup>31</sup> Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done? 

<sup>32</sup> He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb. 

<sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number. 

<sup>34</sup> So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”
