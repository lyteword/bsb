# Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> Then Elihu continued: 

<sup>2</sup> “Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning. 

<sup>3</sup> For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food. 

<sup>4</sup> Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice. 

<sup>6</sup> Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’ 

<sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water? 

<sup>8</sup> He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men. 

<sup>9</sup> For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’ 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly. 

<sup>11</sup> For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences. 

<sup>12</sup> Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice. 

<sup>13</sup> Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world? 

<sup>14</sup> If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath, 

<sup>15</sup> all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words. 

<sup>17</sup> Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One, 

<sup>18</sup> who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’ 

<sup>19</sup> who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands. 

<sup>20</sup> They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. 

<sup>21</sup> For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step. 

<sup>22</sup> There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide. 

<sup>23</sup> For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment. 

<sup>24</sup> He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place. 

<sup>25</sup> Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. 

<sup>26</sup> He strikes them for their wickedness in full view, 

<sup>27</sup> because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways. 

<sup>28</sup> They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted. 

<sup>29</sup> But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation, 

<sup>30</sup> that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people. 

<sup>31</sup> Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more. 

<sup>32</sup> Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’ 

<sup>33</sup> Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know. 

<sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say: 

<sup>35</sup> ‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’ 

<sup>36</sup> If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man. 

<sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
