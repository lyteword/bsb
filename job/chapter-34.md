# Chapter 34

## Elihu Confirms God’s Justice

**¹** Then Elihu continued:

**²** “Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.

**³** For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.

**⁴** Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.

**⁵** For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.

**⁶** Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’

**⁷** What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?

**⁸** He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.

**⁹** For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’

**¹⁰** Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.

**¹¹** For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.

**¹²** Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.

**¹³** Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?

**¹⁴** If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,

**¹⁵** all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.

**¹⁶** If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.

**¹⁷** Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,

**¹⁸** who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’

**¹⁹** who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.

**²⁰** They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.

**²¹** For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.

**²²** There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.

**²³** For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.

**²⁴** He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.

**²⁵** Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.

**²⁶** He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,

**²⁷** because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.

**²⁸** They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.

**²⁹** But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,

**³⁰** that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.

**³¹** Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.

**³²** Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’

**³³** Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed Him? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.

**³⁴** Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:

**³⁵** ‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’

**³⁶** If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.

**³⁷** For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
