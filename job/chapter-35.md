# Chapter 35

## Elihu Recalls God’s Justice

**¹** And Elihu went on to say:

**²** “Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God.’[^2112]

**³** For you ask, ‘What does it profit me, and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’

**⁴** I will reply to you and to your friends as well.

**⁵** Look to the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.

**⁶** If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?

**⁷** If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?

**⁸** Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only a son of man.

**⁹** Men cry out under great oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.

**¹⁰** But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives us songs in the night,

**¹¹** who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’

**¹²** There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.

**¹³** Surely God does not listen to empty pleas, and the Almighty does not take note of it.

**¹⁴** How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,

**¹⁵** and further, that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly!

**¹⁶** So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.”

[^2112]: 35:2 Or ‘I am righteous before God.’
