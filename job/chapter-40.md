# Chapter 40

## Job Humbles Himself before the LORD

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD said to Job:

<sup>2</sup> “Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God give an answer.”

<sup>3</sup> Then Job answered the LORD:

<sup>4</sup> “Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You? I place my hand over my mouth.

<sup>5</sup> I have spoken once, but I have no answer— twice, but I have nothing to add.”

## The LORD Challenges Job Again

<sup>6</sup> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:

<sup>7</sup> “Now brace yourself [^2128] like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.[^2129]

<sup>8</sup> Would you really annul My justice? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?

<sup>9</sup> Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?

<sup>10</sup> Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.

<sup>11</sup> Unleash the fury of your wrath; look on every proud man and bring him low.

<sup>12</sup> Look on every proud man and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.

<sup>13</sup> Bury them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.[^2130]

<sup>14</sup> Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.

<sup>15</sup> Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He feeds on grass like an ox.

<sup>16</sup> See the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.

<sup>17</sup> His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.

<sup>18</sup> His bones are tubes of bronze; his limbs are rods of iron.

<sup>19</sup> He is the foremost of God’s works;[^2131] only his Maker can draw the sword against him.

<sup>20</sup> The hills yield him their produce, while all the beasts of the field play nearby.

<sup>21</sup> He lies under the lotus plants,[^2132] hidden among the reeds of the marsh.

<sup>22</sup> The lotus plants conceal him in their shade; the willows [^2133] of the brook surround him.

<sup>23</sup> Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains secure, though the Jordan surges to his mouth.

<sup>24</sup> Can anyone capture him as he looks on, or pierce his nose with a snare?
