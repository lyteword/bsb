# Chapter 40

## Job Humbles Himself before the LORD

**¹** And the LORD said to Job:

**²** “Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God give an answer.”

**³** Then Job answered the LORD:

**⁴** “Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You? I place my hand over my mouth.

**⁵** I have spoken once, but I have no answer— twice, but I have nothing to add.”

## The LORD Challenges Job Again

**⁶** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:

**⁷** “Now brace yourself [^2128] like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me.[^2129]

**⁸** Would you really annul My justice? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?

**⁹** Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?

**¹⁰** Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.

**¹¹** Unleash the fury of your wrath; look on every proud man and bring him low.

**¹²** Look on every proud man and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.

**¹³** Bury them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.[^2130]

**¹⁴** Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.

**¹⁵** Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He feeds on grass like an ox.

**¹⁶** See the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.

**¹⁷** His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.

**¹⁸** His bones are tubes of bronze; his limbs are rods of iron.

**¹⁹** He is the foremost of God’s works;[^2131] only his Maker can draw the sword against him.

**²⁰** The hills yield him their produce, while all the beasts of the field play nearby.

**²¹** He lies under the lotus plants,[^2132] hidden among the reeds of the marsh.

**²²** The lotus plants conceal him in their shade; the willows [^2133] of the brook surround him.

**²³** Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains secure, though the Jordan surges to his mouth.

**²⁴** Can anyone capture him as he looks on, or pierce his nose with a snare?
