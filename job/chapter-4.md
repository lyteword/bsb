# Chapter 4

## Eliphaz: The Innocent Prosper

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

<sup>2</sup> “If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?

<sup>3</sup> Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.

<sup>4</sup> Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.

<sup>5</sup> But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.

<sup>6</sup> Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?

<sup>7</sup> Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?

<sup>8</sup> As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.

<sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.

<sup>10</sup> The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.

<sup>11</sup> The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

<sup>12</sup> Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.

<sup>13</sup> In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,

<sup>14</sup> fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.

<sup>15</sup> Then a spirit [^2061] glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.

<sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:

<sup>17</sup> ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?

<sup>18</sup> If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,

<sup>19</sup> how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!

<sup>20</sup> They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.

<sup>21</sup> Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’

[^2061]: 4:15 Or a wind
