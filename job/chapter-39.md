# Chapter 39

## The LORD Speaks of His Creation

**¹** “Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?

**²** Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?

**³** They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.

**⁴** Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.

**⁵** Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?

**⁶** I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.

**⁷** He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.

**⁸** He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.

**⁹** Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?

**¹⁰** Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?

**¹¹** Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?

**¹²** Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?

**¹³** The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions [^2125] and feathers of the stork.

**¹⁴** For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.

**¹⁵** She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.

**¹⁶** She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.

**¹⁷** For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.

**¹⁸** Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.

**¹⁹** Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?

**²⁰** Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?

**²¹** He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.

**²²** He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.

**²³** A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.[^2126]

**²⁴** Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.

**²⁵** At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor.[^2127] He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shouts of captains and the cry of war.

**²⁶** Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?

**²⁷** Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?

**²⁸** He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.

**²⁹** From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.

**³⁰** His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”

[^2125]: 39:13 Pinions are the outer parts of a bird’s wings, including the flight feathers.
[^2126]: 39:23 Or javelin
[^2127]: 39:25 Or he snorts, ‘Aha!’
