# Chapter 39

## The LORD Speaks of His Creation

<sup>1</sup> “Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?

<sup>2</sup> Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?

<sup>3</sup> They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.

<sup>5</sup> Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?

<sup>6</sup> I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.

<sup>7</sup> He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.

<sup>8</sup> He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.

<sup>9</sup> Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?

<sup>10</sup> Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?

<sup>11</sup> Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?

<sup>12</sup> Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?

<sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions [^2125] and feathers of the stork.

<sup>14</sup> For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.

<sup>15</sup> She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.

<sup>16</sup> She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.

<sup>17</sup> For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.

<sup>18</sup> Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.

<sup>19</sup> Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?

<sup>20</sup> Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?

<sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.

<sup>22</sup> He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.

<sup>23</sup> A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.[^2126]

<sup>24</sup> Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.

<sup>25</sup> At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor.[^2127] He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shouts of captains and the cry of war.

<sup>26</sup> Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?

<sup>27</sup> Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?

<sup>28</sup> He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.

<sup>29</sup> From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.

<sup>30</sup> His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”

[^2125]: 39:13 Pinions are the outer parts of a bird’s wings, including the flight feathers.
[^2126]: 39:23 Or javelin
[^2127]: 39:25 Or he snorts, ‘Aha!’
