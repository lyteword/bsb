# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> “Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn? 

<sup>2</sup> Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth? 

<sup>3</sup> They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn. 

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return. 

<sup>5</sup> Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness? 

<sup>6</sup> I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling. 

<sup>7</sup> He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver. 

<sup>8</sup> He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night? 

<sup>10</sup> Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you? 

<sup>11</sup> Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him? 

<sup>12</sup> Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor? 

<sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork. 

<sup>14</sup> For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand. 

<sup>15</sup> She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them. 

<sup>16</sup> She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain. 

<sup>17</sup> For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider. 

<sup>19</sup> Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane? 

<sup>20</sup> Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting? 

<sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle. 

<sup>22</sup> He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance. 

<sup>24</sup> Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds. 

<sup>25</sup> At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor. He catches the scent of battle from afar— the shouts of captains and the cry of war. 

<sup>26</sup> Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south? 

<sup>27</sup> Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high? 

<sup>28</sup> He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag. 

<sup>29</sup> From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar. 

<sup>30</sup> His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”
