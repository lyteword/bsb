# Chapter 26

## Job: Who Can Understand God’s Majesty?

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!

**³** How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!

**⁴** To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?

**⁵** The dead tremble— those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.

**⁶** Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon [^2089] has no covering.

**⁷** He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.

**⁸** He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.

**⁹** He covers the face of the full moon,[^2090] spreading over it His cloud.

**¹⁰** He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.

**¹¹** The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.

**¹²** By His power He stirred [^2091] the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.

**¹³** By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.[^2092]

**¹⁴** Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”

[^2089]: 26:6 Abaddon means Destruction.
[^2090]: 26:9 Or of His throne
[^2091]: 26:12 Or stilled
[^2092]: 26:13 Hebrew nachash; translated in most cases as snake
