# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> “How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble! 

<sup>3</sup> How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight! 

<sup>4</sup> To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you? 

<sup>5</sup> The dead tremble— those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them. 

<sup>6</sup> Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 

<sup>7</sup> He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight. 

<sup>9</sup> He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud. 

<sup>10</sup> He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 

<sup>11</sup> The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke. 

<sup>12</sup> By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab. 

<sup>13</sup> By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 

<sup>14</sup> Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
