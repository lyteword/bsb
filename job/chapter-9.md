# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> “Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God? 

<sup>3</sup> If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand. 

<sup>4</sup> God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered? 

<sup>5</sup> He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger. 

<sup>6</sup> He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble. 

<sup>7</sup> He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars. 

<sup>8</sup> He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea. 

<sup>9</sup> He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. 

<sup>10</sup> He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number. 

<sup>11</sup> Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him. 

<sup>12</sup> If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’ 

<sup>13</sup> God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him. 

<sup>14</sup> How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him? 

<sup>15</sup> For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy. 

<sup>16</sup> If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness. 

<sup>19</sup> If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him ? 

<sup>20</sup> Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty. 

<sup>21</sup> Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life. 

<sup>22</sup> It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ 

<sup>23</sup> When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent. 

<sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it? 

<sup>25</sup> My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good. 

<sup>26</sup> They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey. 

<sup>27</sup> If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’ 

<sup>28</sup> I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me. 

<sup>29</sup> Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain? 

<sup>30</sup> If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, 

<sup>31</sup> then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me. 

<sup>32</sup> For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court. 

<sup>33</sup> Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both. 

<sup>34</sup> Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me. 

<sup>35</sup> Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.
