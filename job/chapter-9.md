# Chapter 9

## Job: How Can I Contend with God?

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?

**³** If one wished to contend with God,[^2067] he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.

**⁴** God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?

**⁵** He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.

**⁶** He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.

**⁷** He commands the sun not to shine;[^2068] He seals off the stars.

**⁸** He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.

**⁹** He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.

**¹⁰** He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.

**¹¹** Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.

**¹²** If He takes away,[^2069] who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’

**¹³** God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.

**¹⁴** How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?

**¹⁵** For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.

**¹⁶** If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.

**¹⁷** For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.

**¹⁸** He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.

**¹⁹** If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him [^2070]?

**²⁰** Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.[^2071]

**²¹** Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.

**²²** It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’

**²³** When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.

**²⁴** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?

**²⁵** My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.

**²⁶** They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.

**²⁷** If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’

**²⁸** I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.

**²⁹** Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?

**³⁰** If I should wash myself with snow [^2072] and cleanse my hands with lye,

**³¹** then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me.

**³²** For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.

**³³** Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.

**³⁴** Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.

**³⁵** Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.

[^2067]: 9:3 Or If God wished to contend with someone
[^2068]: 9:7 Or rise
[^2069]: 9:12 Or snatches someone in death
[^2070]: 9:19 See LXX; Hebrew me
[^2071]: 9:20 Or He would declare me guilty
[^2072]: 9:30 Or soap
