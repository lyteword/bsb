# Chapter 27

## Job Affirms His Integrity

<sup>1</sup> Job continued his discourse:

<sup>2</sup> “As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice— the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—

<sup>3</sup> as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,

<sup>4</sup> my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.

<sup>5</sup> I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.

<sup>6</sup> I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.

## The Wicked Man’s Portion

<sup>7</sup> May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.

<sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?

<sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?

<sup>10</sup> Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?

<sup>11</sup> I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.

<sup>12</sup> Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?

<sup>13</sup> This is the wicked man’s portion from God— the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.

<sup>14</sup> Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.

<sup>15</sup> His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.

<sup>16</sup> Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,

<sup>17</sup> what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.

<sup>18</sup> The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.

<sup>19</sup> He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.

<sup>20</sup> Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.

<sup>21</sup> The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.

<sup>22</sup> It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.

<sup>23</sup> It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.
