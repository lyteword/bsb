# Chapter 27

## Job Affirms His Integrity

**¹** Job continued his discourse:

**²** “As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice— the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—

**³** as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,

**⁴** my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.

**⁵** I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.

**⁶** I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.

## The Wicked Man’s Portion

**⁷** May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.

**⁸** For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?

**⁹** Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?

**¹⁰** Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?

**¹¹** I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.

**¹²** Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?

**¹³** This is the wicked man’s portion from God— the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.

**¹⁴** Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.

**¹⁵** His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.

**¹⁶** Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,

**¹⁷** what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.

**¹⁸** The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.

**¹⁹** He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.

**²⁰** Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.

**²¹** The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.

**²²** It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.

**²³** It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.
