# Chapter 3

## Job Laments His Birth

**¹** After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.

**²** And this is what he said:

**³** “May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’

**⁴** If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it.

**⁵** May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.

**⁶** If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year; may it never be entered in any of the months.

**⁷** Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it.

**⁸** May it be cursed by those who curse the day [^2060]— those prepared to rouse Leviathan.

**⁹** May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn.

**¹⁰** For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes.

**¹¹** Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb?

**¹²** Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed?

**¹³** For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest

**¹⁴** with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins,

**¹⁵** or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.

**¹⁶** Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight?

**¹⁷** There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest.

**¹⁸** The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.

**¹⁹** Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.

**²⁰** Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul,

**²¹** who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure,

**²²** who rejoice and greatly exult when they reach the grave?

**²³** Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?

**²⁴** I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.

**²⁵** For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me.

**²⁶** I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”

[^2060]: 3:8 Or curse the sea
