# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 

<sup>2</sup> And this is what he said: 

<sup>3</sup> “May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’ 

<sup>4</sup> If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it. 

<sup>6</sup> If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year; may it never be entered in any of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it. 

<sup>8</sup> May it be cursed by those who curse the day — those prepared to rouse Leviathan. 

<sup>9</sup> May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn. 

<sup>10</sup> For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb? 

<sup>12</sup> Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed? 

<sup>13</sup> For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest 

<sup>14</sup> with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins, 

<sup>15</sup> or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 

<sup>16</sup> Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight? 

<sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest. 

<sup>18</sup> The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor. 

<sup>19</sup> Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul, 

<sup>21</sup> who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure, 

<sup>22</sup> who rejoice and greatly exult when they can find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water. 

<sup>25</sup> For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me. 

<sup>26</sup> I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”
