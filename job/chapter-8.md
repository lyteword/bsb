# Chapter 8

## Bildad: Job Should Repent

**¹** Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

**²** “How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.

**³** Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?

**⁴** When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.

**⁵** But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,

**⁶** if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.

**⁷** Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.

**⁸** Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.

**⁹** For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.

**¹⁰** Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?

**¹¹** Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?

**¹²** While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up more quickly than grass.

**¹³** Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.

**¹⁴** His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.

**¹⁵** He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.

**¹⁶** He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.

**¹⁷** His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.

**¹⁸** If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’

**¹⁹** Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.

**²⁰** Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.

**²¹** He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.

**²²** Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
