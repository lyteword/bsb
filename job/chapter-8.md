## Bildad: Job Should Repent

<sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.

<sup>3</sup> Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?

<sup>4</sup> When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.

<sup>5</sup> But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,

<sup>6</sup> if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.

<sup>7</sup> Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.

<sup>8</sup> Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.

<sup>9</sup> For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.

<sup>10</sup> Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?

<sup>11</sup> Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?

<sup>12</sup> While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up more quickly than grass.

<sup>13</sup> Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.

<sup>14</sup> His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.

<sup>15</sup> He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.

<sup>16</sup> He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.

<sup>17</sup> His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.

<sup>18</sup> If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’

<sup>19</sup> Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.

<sup>20</sup> Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.

<sup>21</sup> He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.

<sup>22</sup> Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
