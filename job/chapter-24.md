# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> “Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why may those who know Him never see His days? 

<sup>2</sup> Men move boundary stones; they pasture stolen flocks. 

<sup>3</sup> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge. 

<sup>4</sup> They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding. 

<sup>5</sup> Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go to work foraging for food; the wasteland is food for their children. 

<sup>6</sup> They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter. 

<sup>9</sup> The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt. 

<sup>10</sup> Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry. 

<sup>11</sup> They crush olives within their walls; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty. 

<sup>12</sup> From the city, men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out, yet God charges no one with wrongdoing. 

<sup>13</sup> Then there are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths. 

<sup>14</sup> When daylight is gone, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; in the night he is like a thief. 

<sup>15</sup> The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face. 

<sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in, never to experience the light. 

<sup>17</sup> For to them, deep darkness is their morning; surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness! 

<sup>18</sup> They are but foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one turns toward their vineyards. 

<sup>19</sup> As drought and heat consume the melting snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned. 

<sup>20</sup> The womb forgets them; the worm feeds on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is like a broken tree. 

<sup>21</sup> They prey on the barren and childless, and show no kindness to the widow. 

<sup>22</sup> Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty; though rising up, they have no assurance of life. 

<sup>23</sup> He gives them a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways. 

<sup>24</sup> They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain. 

<sup>25</sup> If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing?”
