# Chapter 32

## Elihu Rebukes Job’s Friends

**¹** So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

**²** This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,

**³** and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.

**⁴** Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.

**⁵** But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.

**⁶** So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.

**⁷** I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.

**⁸** But there is a spirit [^2108] in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.

**⁹** It is not only the old [^2109] who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.

**¹⁰** Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’

**¹¹** Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,

**¹²** I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.

**¹³** So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’

**¹⁴** But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.

**¹⁵** Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.

**¹⁶** Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?

**¹⁷** I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.

**¹⁸** For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.

**¹⁹** Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.

**²⁰** I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.

**²¹** I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.

**²²** For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.

[^2108]: 32:8 Or the Spirit; similarly in verse 18
[^2109]: 32:9 Or many or great
