# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God, 

<sup>3</sup> and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he. 

<sup>5</sup> But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled. 

<sup>6</sup> So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know. 

<sup>7</sup> I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom. 

<sup>8</sup> But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’ 

<sup>11</sup> Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words, 

<sup>12</sup> I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments. 

<sup>13</sup> So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’ 

<sup>14</sup> But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. 

<sup>15</sup> Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them. 

<sup>16</sup> Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply? 

<sup>17</sup> I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know. 

<sup>18</sup> For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin. 

<sup>20</sup> I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond. 

<sup>21</sup> I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man. 

<sup>22</sup> For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.
