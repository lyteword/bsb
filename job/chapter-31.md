# Chapter 31

## Job’s Final Appeal

**¹** “I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?

**²** For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high?

**³** Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity?

**⁴** Does He not see my ways and count my every step?

**⁵** If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,

**⁶** let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity.

**⁷** If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands,

**⁸** then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.

**⁹** If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door,

**¹⁰** then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her.

**¹¹** For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged.

**¹²** For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon;[^2104] it would root out my entire harvest.

**¹³** If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,

**¹⁴** what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account?

**¹⁵** Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb?

**¹⁶** If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,

**¹⁷** if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless—

**¹⁸** though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—

**¹⁹** if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak,

**²⁰** if his heart has not blessed me [^2105] for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,

**²¹** if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate,

**²²** then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket.

**²³** For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower.

**²⁴** If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security,

**²⁵** if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much,

**²⁶** if I have beheld the sun [^2106] in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,

**²⁷** so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,

**²⁸** this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high.

**²⁹** If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him—

**³⁰** I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse—

**³¹** if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—

**³²** but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler—

**³³** if I have covered my transgressions like Adam [^2107] by hiding my guilt in my heart,

**³⁴** because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside—

**³⁵** (Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment.

**³⁶** Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.

**³⁷** I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)—

**³⁸** if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together,

**³⁹** if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,

**⁴⁰** then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.

[^2104]: 31:12 Abaddon means Destruction.
[^2105]: 31:20 Hebrew if his loins have not blessed me
[^2106]: 31:26 Hebrew the light
[^2107]: 31:33 Or like men
