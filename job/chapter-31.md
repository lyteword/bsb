# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> “I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin? 

<sup>2</sup> For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high? 

<sup>3</sup> Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> Does He not see my ways and count my every step? 

<sup>5</sup> If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit, 

<sup>6</sup> let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity. 

<sup>7</sup> If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands, 

<sup>8</sup> then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted. 

<sup>9</sup> If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door, 

<sup>10</sup> then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her. 

<sup>11</sup> For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged. 

<sup>12</sup> For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; it would root out my entire harvest. 

<sup>13</sup> If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me, 

<sup>14</sup> what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account? 

<sup>15</sup> Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail, 

<sup>17</sup> if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless— 

<sup>18</sup> though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow— 

<sup>19</sup> if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak, 

<sup>20</sup> if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep, 

<sup>21</sup> if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate, 

<sup>22</sup> then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket. 

<sup>23</sup> For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower. 

<sup>24</sup> If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security, 

<sup>25</sup> if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much, 

<sup>26</sup> if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor, 

<sup>27</sup> so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, 

<sup>28</sup> this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high. 

<sup>29</sup> If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him— 

<sup>30</sup> I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse— 

<sup>31</sup> if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’— 

<sup>32</sup> but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler— 

<sup>33</sup> if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart, 

<sup>34</sup> because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside— 

<sup>35</sup> (Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment. 

<sup>36</sup> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown. 

<sup>37</sup> I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)— 

<sup>38</sup> if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together, 

<sup>39</sup> if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants, 

<sup>40</sup> then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.
