# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> â€œEven today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 

<sup>3</sup> If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat. 

<sup>4</sup> I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments. 

<sup>5</sup> I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say. 

<sup>6</sup> Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me. 

<sup>7</sup> Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge. 

<sup>8</sup> If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him. 

<sup>9</sup> When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him. 

<sup>10</sup> Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold. 

<sup>11</sup> My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside. 

<sup>12</sup> I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread. 

<sup>13</sup> But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires. 

<sup>14</sup> For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him. 

<sup>16</sup> God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me. 

<sup>17</sup> Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
