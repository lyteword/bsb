# Chapter 23

## Job Longs for God

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “Even today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.

**³** If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat.

**⁴** I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.

**⁵** I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say.

**⁶** Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me.

**⁷** Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.

**⁸** If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him.

**⁹** When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.

**¹⁰** Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.

**¹¹** My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside.

**¹²** I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.

**¹³** But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.

**¹⁴** For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans.

**¹⁵** Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him.

**¹⁶** God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.

**¹⁷** Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
