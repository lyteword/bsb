## Elihu Describes God’s Power

**¹** And Elihu continued:

**²** “Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.

**³** I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.

**⁴** For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.

**⁵** Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.

**⁶** He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.

**⁷** He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.

**⁸** And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,

**⁹** then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.

**¹⁰** He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.

**¹¹** If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.

**¹²** But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword [^2113] and die without knowledge.

**¹³** The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.

**¹⁴** They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes.

**¹⁵** God rescues the afflicted by their affliction [^2114] and opens their ears in oppression.

**¹⁶** Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.

**¹⁷** But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.

**¹⁸** Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.

**¹⁹** Can your wealth [^2115] or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?

**²⁰** Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.

**²¹** Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.

**²²** Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?

**²³** Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?

**²⁴** Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.

**²⁵** All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.

**²⁶** Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.

**²⁷** For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,

**²⁸** which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.

**²⁹** Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?

**³⁰** See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.

**³¹** For by these He judges [^2116] the nations and provides food in abundance.

**³²** He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.

**³³** The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.

[^2113]: 36:12 Or they will cross the river of death
[^2114]: 36:15 Or in their affliction
[^2115]: 36:19 Or your cry for help
[^2116]: 36:31 Or governs or nourishes
