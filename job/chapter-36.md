# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu continued: 

<sup>2</sup> “Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf. 

<sup>3</sup> I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you. 

<sup>5</sup> Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding. 

<sup>6</sup> He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted. 

<sup>7</sup> He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever. 

<sup>8</sup> And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction, 

<sup>9</sup> then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed. 

<sup>10</sup> He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness. 

<sup>12</sup> But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help. 

<sup>14</sup> They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes. 

<sup>15</sup> God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression. 

<sup>16</sup> Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness. 

<sup>17</sup> But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you. 

<sup>18</sup> Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray. 

<sup>19</sup> Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress? 

<sup>20</sup> Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes. 

<sup>21</sup> Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction. 

<sup>22</sup> Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him? 

<sup>23</sup> Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’? 

<sup>24</sup> Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song. 

<sup>25</sup> All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar. 

<sup>26</sup> Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable. 

<sup>27</sup> For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist, 

<sup>28</sup> which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind. 

<sup>29</sup> Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion? 

<sup>30</sup> See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea. 

<sup>31</sup> For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance. 

<sup>32</sup> He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark. 

<sup>33</sup> The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.
