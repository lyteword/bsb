## Zophar: Destruction Awaits the Wicked

**¹** Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:

**²** “So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me.

**³** I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply.

**⁴** Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth,

**⁵** the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary?

**⁶** Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,

**⁷** he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’

**⁸** He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.

**⁹** The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him.

**¹⁰** His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth.

**¹¹** The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust.

**¹²** Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,

**¹³** though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,

**¹⁴** yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him.

**¹⁵** He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach.

**¹⁶** He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him.

**¹⁷** He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.

**¹⁸** He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.

**¹⁹** For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build.

**²⁰** Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure.

**²¹** Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure.

**²²** In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him.

**²³** When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats.

**²⁴** Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.

**²⁵** It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver.[^2085] Terrors come over him.

**²⁶** Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.

**²⁷** The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.

**²⁸** The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.

**²⁹** This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”

[^2085]: 20:25 Literally from his gall
