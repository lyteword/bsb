# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: 

<sup>2</sup> “So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me. 

<sup>3</sup> I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply. 

<sup>4</sup> Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth, 

<sup>5</sup> the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary? 

<sup>6</sup> Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds, 

<sup>7</sup> he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’ 

<sup>8</sup> He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night. 

<sup>9</sup> The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him. 

<sup>10</sup> His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth. 

<sup>11</sup> The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue, 

<sup>13</sup> though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth, 

<sup>14</sup> yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him. 

<sup>15</sup> He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach. 

<sup>16</sup> He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him. 

<sup>17</sup> He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream. 

<sup>18</sup> He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading. 

<sup>19</sup> For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build. 

<sup>20</sup> Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure. 

<sup>21</sup> Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure. 

<sup>22</sup> In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats. 

<sup>24</sup> Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him. 

<sup>25</sup> It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver. Terrors come over him. 

<sup>26</sup> Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent. 

<sup>27</sup> The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”
