# Chapter 41

## The LORD’s Power Shown in Leviathan

**¹** “Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?

**²** Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?

**³** Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?

**⁴** Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?

**⁵** Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?

**⁶** Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?

**⁷** Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?

**⁸** If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!

**⁹** Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?

**¹⁰** No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?

**¹¹** Who has given to Me that I should repay him?[^2134] Everything under heaven is Mine.

**¹²** I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.

**¹³** Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?[^2135]

**¹⁴** Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?

**¹⁵** His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.

**¹⁶** One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.

**¹⁷** They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.

**¹⁸** His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.

**¹⁹** Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!

**²⁰** Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.

**²¹** His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.

**²²** Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.

**²³** The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.

**²⁴** His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!

**²⁵** When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.

**²⁶** The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.

**²⁷** He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.

**²⁸** No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.

**²⁹** A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.[^2136]

**³⁰** His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.

**³¹** He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.

**³²** He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!

**³³** Nothing on earth is his equal— a creature devoid of fear!

**³⁴** He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”
