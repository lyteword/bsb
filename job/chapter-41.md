# Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> “Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope? 

<sup>2</sup> Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 

<sup>3</sup> Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly? 

<sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life? 

<sup>5</sup> Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens? 

<sup>6</sup> Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants? 

<sup>7</sup> Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 

<sup>8</sup> If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it! 

<sup>9</sup> Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming? 

<sup>10</sup> No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me? 

<sup>11</sup> Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine. 

<sup>12</sup> I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form. 

<sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle? 

<sup>14</sup> Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth? 

<sup>15</sup> His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together. 

<sup>16</sup> One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them. 

<sup>17</sup> They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated. 

<sup>18</sup> His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn. 

<sup>19</sup> Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth! 

<sup>20</sup> Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds. 

<sup>21</sup> His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth. 

<sup>22</sup> Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him. 

<sup>23</sup> The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. 

<sup>24</sup> His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone! 

<sup>25</sup> When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing. 

<sup>26</sup> The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow. 

<sup>27</sup> He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood. 

<sup>28</sup> No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him. 

<sup>29</sup> A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance. 

<sup>30</sup> His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge. 

<sup>31</sup> He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment. 

<sup>32</sup> He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair! 

<sup>33</sup> Nothing on earth is his equal— a creature devoid of fear! 

<sup>34</sup> He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”
