# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: 

<sup>2</sup> “Can a man be of use to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him? 

<sup>3</sup> Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? Does He profit if your ways are blameless? 

<sup>4</sup> Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you? 

<sup>5</sup> Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless? 

<sup>6</sup> For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers and deprived the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> You gave no water to the weary and withheld food from the famished, 

<sup>8</sup> while the land belonged to a mighty man, and a man of honor lived on it. 

<sup>9</sup> You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore snares surround you, and sudden peril terrifies you; 

<sup>11</sup> it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 

<sup>12</sup> Is not God as high as the heavens? Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are! 

<sup>13</sup> Yet you say: ‘What does God know? Does He judge through thick darkness? 

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us as He traverses the vault of heaven.’ 

<sup>15</sup> Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod? 

<sup>16</sup> They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were swept away by a flood. 

<sup>17</sup> They said to God, ‘Depart from us. What can the Almighty do to us?’ 

<sup>18</sup> But it was He who filled their houses with good things; so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent mock them: 

<sup>20</sup> ‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire has consumed their excess.’ 

<sup>21</sup> Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; thereby good will come to you. 

<sup>22</sup> Receive instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart. 

<sup>23</sup> If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove injustice from your tents 

<sup>24</sup> and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines, 

<sup>25</sup> then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you. 

<sup>26</sup> Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. 

<sup>27</sup> You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows. 

<sup>28</sup> Your decisions will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways. 

<sup>29</sup> When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then He will save the lowly. 

<sup>30</sup> He will deliver even one who is not innocent, rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.”
