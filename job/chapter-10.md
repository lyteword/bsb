# Chapter 10

## Job’s Plea to God

**¹** “I loathe my own life; I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.

**²** I will say to God: Do not condemn me! Let me know why You prosecute me.

**³** Does it please You to oppress me, to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?

**⁴** Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?

**⁵** Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a man,

**⁶** that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin—

**⁷** though You know that I am not guilty, and there is no deliverance from Your hand?

**⁸** Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. Would You now turn and destroy me?

**⁹** Please remember that You molded me like clay. Would You now return me to dust?

**¹⁰** Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?

**¹¹** You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.

**¹²** You have granted me life and loving devotion,[^2073] and Your care has preserved my spirit.

**¹³** Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, and I know that this was in Your mind:

**¹⁴** If I sinned, You would take note, and would not acquit me of my iniquity.

**¹⁵** If I am guilty, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and aware of my affliction.

**¹⁶** Should I hold my head high, You would hunt me like a lion, and again display Your power against me.

**¹⁷** You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me in wave after wave.

**¹⁸** Why then did You bring me from the womb? Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!

**¹⁹** If only I had never come to be, but had been carried from the womb to the grave.

**²⁰** Are my days not few? Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort,

**²¹** before I go—never to return— to a land of darkness and gloom,

**²²** to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”

[^2073]: 10:12 Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.
