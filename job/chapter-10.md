# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> “I loathe my own life; I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> I will say to God: Do not condemn me! Let me know why You prosecute me. 

<sup>3</sup> Does it please You to oppress me, to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked? 

<sup>4</sup> Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees? 

<sup>5</sup> Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a man, 

<sup>6</sup> that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin— 

<sup>7</sup> though You know that I am not guilty, and there is no deliverance from Your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. Would You now turn and destroy me? 

<sup>9</sup> Please remember that You molded me like clay. Would You now return me to dust? 

<sup>10</sup> Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese? 

<sup>11</sup> You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 

<sup>12</sup> You have granted me life and loving devotion, and Your care has preserved my spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, and I know that this was in Your mind: 

<sup>14</sup> If I sinned, You would take note, and would not acquit me of my iniquity. 

<sup>15</sup> If I am guilty, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and aware of my affliction. 

<sup>16</sup> Should I hold my head high, You would hunt me like a lion, and again display Your power against me. 

<sup>17</sup> You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me in wave after wave. 

<sup>18</sup> Why then did You bring me from the womb? Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me! 

<sup>19</sup> If only I had never come to be, but had been carried from the womb to the grave. 

<sup>20</sup> Are my days not few? Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort, 

<sup>21</sup> before I go—never to return— to a land of darkness and gloom, 

<sup>22</sup> to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
