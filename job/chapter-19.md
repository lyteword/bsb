# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you torment me and crush me with your words? 

<sup>3</sup> Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me. 

<sup>4</sup> Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone. 

<sup>5</sup> If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me, 

<sup>6</sup> then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me. 

<sup>7</sup> Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice. 

<sup>8</sup> He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness. 

<sup>9</sup> He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head. 

<sup>10</sup> He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree. 

<sup>11</sup> His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies. 

<sup>12</sup> His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 

<sup>13</sup> He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me. 

<sup>14</sup> My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me. 

<sup>15</sup> My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight. 

<sup>16</sup> I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family. 

<sup>18</sup> Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me. 

<sup>19</sup> All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me. 

<sup>20</sup> My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

<sup>21</sup> Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me. 

<sup>22</sup> Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh? 

<sup>23</sup> I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book, 

<sup>24</sup> by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever. 

<sup>25</sup> But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God. 

<sup>27</sup> I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me! 

<sup>28</sup> If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’ 

<sup>29</sup> then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”
