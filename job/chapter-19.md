# Chapter 19

## Job: My Redeemer Lives

**¹** Then Job answered:

**²** “How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?

**³** Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.

**⁴** Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.

**⁵** If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,

**⁶** then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.

**⁷** Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.

**⁸** He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.

**⁹** He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.

**¹⁰** He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.

**¹¹** His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.

**¹²** His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.

**¹³** He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.

**¹⁴** My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.

**¹⁵** My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.

**¹⁶** I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.

**¹⁷** My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.

**¹⁸** Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.

**¹⁹** All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.

**²⁰** My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

**²¹** Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.

**²²** Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?

**²³** I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,

**²⁴** by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.

**²⁵** But I know that my Redeemer [^2080] lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.[^2081]

**²⁶** Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh [^2082] I will see God.

**²⁷** I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns [^2083] within me!

**²⁸** If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,[^2084]’

**²⁹** then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”
