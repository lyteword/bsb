# Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> “At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place. 

<sup>2</sup> Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds. 

<sup>5</sup> God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend. 

<sup>6</sup> For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’ 

<sup>7</sup> He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work. 

<sup>8</sup> The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens. 

<sup>9</sup> The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds. 

<sup>10</sup> By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen. 

<sup>11</sup> He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them. 

<sup>12</sup> They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion. 

<sup>14</sup> Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God. 

<sup>15</sup> Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash? 

<sup>16</sup> Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge? 

<sup>17</sup> You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind, 

<sup>18</sup> can you, like Him, spread out the skies to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze? 

<sup>19</sup> Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness. 

<sup>20</sup> Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up ? 

<sup>21</sup> Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean. 

<sup>22</sup> Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him. 

<sup>23</sup> The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress. 

<sup>24</sup> Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”
