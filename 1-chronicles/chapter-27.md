<sup>22</sup> and over Dan was Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.

<sup>23</sup> David did not count the men aged twenty or under, because the LORD had said that He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of the sky.

<sup>24</sup> Joab son of Zeruiah began to count the men but did not finish. For because of this census wrath came upon Israel, and the number was not entered in the Book of the Chronicles of King David.
