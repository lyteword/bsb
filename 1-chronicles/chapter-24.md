# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

<sup>2</sup> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 

<sup>3</sup> With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service. 

<sup>4</sup> Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar. 

<sup>5</sup> Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants. 

<sup>6</sup> The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar. 

<sup>7</sup> The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 

<sup>8</sup> the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 

<sup>9</sup> the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 

<sup>10</sup> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 

<sup>11</sup> the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 

<sup>12</sup> the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 

<sup>13</sup> the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 

<sup>14</sup> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 

<sup>15</sup> the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, 

<sup>16</sup> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, 

<sup>17</sup> the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 

<sup>18</sup> the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 

<sup>19</sup> This was their appointed order for service when they entered the house of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him. 

<sup>20</sup> Now these were the remaining descendants of Levi: From the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah. 

<sup>21</sup> As for Rehabiah, from his sons: The first was Isshiah. 

<sup>22</sup> From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath. 

<sup>23</sup> From the sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 

<sup>24</sup> From the sons of Uzziel: Micah; from the sons of Micah: Shamir. 

<sup>25</sup> The brother of Micah: Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah. 

<sup>26</sup> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. 

<sup>27</sup> The descendants of Merari from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 

<sup>28</sup> From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 

<sup>29</sup> From Kish: Jerahmeel the son of Kish. 

<sup>30</sup> And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, according to their families. 

<sup>31</sup> As their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, they also cast lots in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites—the family heads and their younger brothers alike.
