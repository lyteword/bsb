<sup>43</sup> These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites: Bela son of Beor. His city was named Dinhabah. 

<sup>44</sup> When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 

<sup>45</sup> When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

<sup>48</sup> When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place.

<sup>50</sup> When Baal-hanan died, Hadad reigned in his place. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.
