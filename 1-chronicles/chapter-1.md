<sup>44</sup> When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.

<sup>45</sup> When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

<sup>46</sup> When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith.

<sup>47</sup> When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.

<sup>48</sup> When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates [^1483] reigned in his place.

<sup>49</sup> When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place.

<sup>50</sup> When Baal-hanan died, Hadad reigned in his place. His city was named Pau,[^1484] and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.

<sup>51</sup> Then Hadad died. Now the chiefs of Edom were Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,

<sup>52</sup> Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,

<sup>53</sup> Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,

<sup>54</sup> Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom.
