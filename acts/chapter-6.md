# Chapter 6

## The Choosing of the Seven

**(1 Timothy 3:8–13)**

<sup>1</sup> In those days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Grecian Jews among them began to grumble against the Hebraic Jews [^4160] because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.

<sup>2</sup> So the Twelve summoned all the disciples and said, “It is unacceptable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.

<sup>3</sup> Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men confirmed to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will assign this responsibility to them

<sup>4</sup> and will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

<sup>5</sup> This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, as well as Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.[^4161]

<sup>6</sup> They presented these seven to the apostles,[^4162] who prayed and laid their hands on them.

<sup>7</sup> So the word of God continued to spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly, and a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.

## The Arrest of Stephen

<sup>8</sup> Now Stephen, who was full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.

<sup>9</sup> But resistance arose from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, including Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia.[^4163] They disputed with Stephen,

<sup>10</sup> but they could not stand up to his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.

<sup>11</sup> Then they prompted some men to say, “We heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.”

<sup>12</sup> So they stirred up the people, elders, and scribes and confronted Stephen. They seized him and brought him before the Sanhedrin,[^4164]

<sup>13</sup> where they presented false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.

<sup>14</sup> For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”

<sup>15</sup> All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
