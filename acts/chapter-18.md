# Chapter 18

## Paul Ministers in Corinth

**(1 Corinthians 1:1–3; 2 Corinthians 1:1–2)**

**¹** After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

**²** There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,

**³** and he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade, just as he was.

**⁴** Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike.

**⁵** And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

**⁶** But when they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”

**⁷** So Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titus Justus,[^4228] a worshiper of God.

**⁸** Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized.

**⁹** One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking; do not be silent.

**¹⁰** For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on you, because I have many people in this city.”

**¹¹** So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the Corinthians.

## Paul before Gallio

**¹²** While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews coordinated an attack on Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.

**¹³** “This man is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law,” they said.

**¹⁴** But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint.

**¹⁵** But since it is a dispute about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.”

**¹⁶** And he drove them away from the judgment seat.

**¹⁷** At this, the crowd[^4229] seized Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was of concern to Gallio.

## Paul Returns to Antioch

**¹⁸** Paul remained in Corinth for quite some time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.

**¹⁹** When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue there and reasoned with the Jews.

**²⁰** When they asked him to stay for a while longer, he declined.

**²¹** But as he left, he said, “I will come back [^4230] to you if God is willing.” And he set sail from Ephesus.

**²²** When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem.[^4231] Then he went down to Antioch.

## Paul’s Third Missionary Journey Begins

**(Acts 13:1–3; Acts 15:36–41)**

**²³** After Paul had spent some time in Antioch, he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.

**²⁴** Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures.

**²⁵** He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was fervent in spirit. He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus,[^4232] though he knew only the baptism of John.

**²⁶** And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

**²⁷** When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.

**²⁸** For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
