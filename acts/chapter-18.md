# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 

<sup>2</sup> There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them, 

<sup>3</sup> and he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade, just as he was. 

<sup>4</sup> Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike. 

<sup>5</sup> And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. 

<sup>6</sup> But when they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” 

<sup>7</sup> So Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titus Justus, a worshiper of God. 

<sup>8</sup> Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized. 

<sup>9</sup> One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking; do not be silent. 

<sup>10</sup> For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on you, because I have many people in this city.” 

<sup>11</sup> So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the Corinthians. 

<sup>12</sup> While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews coordinated an attack on Paul and brought him before the judgment seat. 

<sup>13</sup> “This man is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law,” they said. 

<sup>14</sup> But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint. 

<sup>15</sup> But since it is a dispute about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.” 

<sup>16</sup> And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 

<sup>17</sup> At this, the crowd seized Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none of this was of concern to Gallio. 

<sup>18</sup> Paul remained in Corinth for quite some time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. 

<sup>19</sup> When they reached Ephesus, Paul parted ways with Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue there and reasoned with the Jews. 

<sup>20</sup> When they asked him to stay for a while longer, he declined. 

<sup>21</sup> But as he left, he said, “I will come back to you if God is willing.” And he set sail from Ephesus. 

<sup>22</sup> When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem. Then he went down to Antioch. 

<sup>23</sup> After Paul had spent some time in Antioch, he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 

<sup>24</sup> Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures. 

<sup>25</sup> He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was fervent in spirit. He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. 

<sup>26</sup> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him in and explained to him the way of God more accurately. 

<sup>27</sup> When Apollos resolved to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. 

<sup>28</sup> For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
