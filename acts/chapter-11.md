# Chapter 11

## Peter’s Report at Jerusalem

<sup>1</sup> The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

<sup>2</sup> So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers [^4197] took issue with him

<sup>3</sup> and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.”

<sup>4</sup> But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events:

<sup>5</sup> “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me.

<sup>6</sup> I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.

<sup>7</sup> Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’

<sup>8</sup> ‘No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing impure [^4198] or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’

<sup>9</sup> But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’

<sup>10</sup> This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into heaven.

<sup>11</sup> Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.

<sup>12</sup> The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s home.

<sup>13</sup> He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.

<sup>14</sup> He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.’

<sup>15</sup> As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning.

<sup>16</sup> Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’[^4199]

<sup>17</sup> So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?”

<sup>18</sup> When they heard this, they had no further objections, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”

## The Church at Antioch

<sup>19</sup> Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews.

<sup>20</sup> But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks [^4200] as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.

<sup>21</sup> The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.

<sup>22</sup> When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

<sup>23</sup> When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts.

<sup>24</sup> Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.

<sup>25</sup> Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,

<sup>26</sup> and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.

<sup>27</sup> In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

<sup>28</sup> One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole world.[^4201] (This happened under Claudius.)

<sup>29</sup> So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.

<sup>30</sup> This they did, sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul.
