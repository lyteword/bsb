# Chapter 8

## Saul Persecutes the Church

<sup>1</sup> And Saul was there, giving approval to Stephen’s death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.

<sup>2</sup> God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him.

<sup>3</sup> But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.

## Philip in Samaria

<sup>4</sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.

<sup>5</sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.

<sup>6</sup> The crowds all paid close attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him perform.

<sup>7</sup> With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed.

<sup>8</sup> So there was great joy in that city.

## Simon the Sorcerer

**(Deuteronomy 18:9–14)**

<sup>9</sup> Prior to that time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great,

<sup>10</sup> and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the Great Power.”

<sup>11</sup> They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery.

<sup>12</sup> But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

<sup>13</sup> Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.

<sup>14</sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.

<sup>15</sup> On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.

<sup>16</sup> For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.

<sup>17</sup> Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

<sup>18</sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.

<sup>19</sup> “Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”

<sup>20</sup> But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!

<sup>21</sup> You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God.

<sup>22</sup> Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart.

<sup>23</sup> For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.”

<sup>24</sup> Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”

<sup>25</sup> And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages.

## Philip and the Ethiopian

**(Isaiah 53:1–8)**

<sup>26</sup> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”

<sup>27</sup> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace,[^4182] queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,

<sup>28</sup> and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.

<sup>29</sup> The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.”

<sup>30</sup> So Philip ran up and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.

<sup>31</sup> “How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

<sup>32</sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so He did not open His mouth.

<sup>33</sup> In His humiliation He was deprived of justice. Who can recount His descendants? For His life was removed from the earth.”[^4183]

<sup>34</sup> “Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”

<sup>35</sup> Then Philip began with this very Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.

<sup>36</sup> As they traveled along the road and came to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there to prevent me from being baptized?”[^4184]

<sup>38</sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.

<sup>39</sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.

<sup>40</sup> But Philip appeared at Azotus and traveled through that region, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.

[^4182]: 8:27 Greek Kandakē
[^4183]: 8:33 Isaiah 53:7–8 (see also LXX)
[^4184]: 8:36 TR includes 37 And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.” The eunuch replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”
