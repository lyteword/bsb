# Chapter 24

## Tertullus Prosecutes Paul

**¹** Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer [^4261] named Tertullus, who presented to the governor their case against Paul.

**²** When Paul had been called in, Tertullus opened the prosecution: “Because of you, we have enjoyed a lasting peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation.

**³** In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude.

**⁴** But in order not to delay you any further, I beg your indulgence to hear us briefly.

**⁵** We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,

**⁶** and he even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.[^4262]

**⁸** By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all our charges against him.”

**⁹** The Jews concurred, asserting that these charges were true.

## Paul’s Defense to Felix

**¹⁰** When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he began his response: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense.

**¹¹** You can verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

**¹²** Yet my accusers did not find me debating with anyone in the temple or riling up a crowd in the synagogues or in the city.

**¹³** Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me.

**¹⁴** I do confess to you, however, that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,

**¹⁵** and I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.

**¹⁶** In this hope, I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man.

**¹⁷** After several years, then, I returned to Jerusalem to bring alms to my people and to present offerings.

**¹⁸** At the time they found me in the temple, I was ceremonially clean and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar. But there are some Jews from the province of Asia [^4263]

**¹⁹** who ought to appear before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me.

**²⁰** Otherwise, let these men state for themselves any crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin,[^4264]

**²¹** unless it was this one thing I called out as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”

## The Verdict Postponed

**²²** Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “When Lysias the commander comes, I will decide your case.”

**²³** He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard, but to allow him some freedom and permit his friends to minister to his needs.

**²⁴** After several days, Felix returned with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.

**²⁵** As Paul expounded on righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.”

**²⁶** At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe. So he sent for Paul frequently and talked with him.

**²⁷** After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
