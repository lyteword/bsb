# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, who presented to the governor their case against Paul. 

<sup>2</sup> When Paul had been called in, Tertullus opened the prosecution: â€œBecause of you, we have enjoyed a lasting peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation. 

<sup>3</sup> In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. 

<sup>4</sup> But in order not to burden you any further, I beg your indulgence to hear us briefly. 

<sup>5</sup> We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, 

<sup>6</sup> and he even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.
