# Chapter 3

## Faith and Belief

**(James 2:14–26)**

<sup>1</sup> O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.

<sup>2</sup> I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?

<sup>3</sup> Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh?

<sup>4</sup> Have you suffered so much for nothing, if it really was for nothing?

<sup>5</sup> Does God lavish His Spirit on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or because you hear and believe?

<sup>6</sup> So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”[^4484]

<sup>7</sup> Understand, then, that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.

<sup>8</sup> The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”[^4485]

<sup>9</sup> So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.

## Christ Has Redeemed Us

<sup>10</sup> All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”[^4486]

<sup>11</sup> Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.”[^4487]

<sup>12</sup> The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.”[^4488]

<sup>13</sup> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”[^4489]

<sup>14</sup> He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham [^4490] would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.

## The Purpose of the Law

**(Romans 7:1–6)**

<sup>15</sup> Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or amended.

<sup>16</sup> The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,”[^4491] meaning One, who is Christ.

<sup>17</sup> What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise.

<sup>18</sup> For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise.

<sup>19</sup> Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator.

<sup>20</sup> A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one.

<sup>21</sup> Is the law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law.

<sup>22</sup> But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.

<sup>23</sup> Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.

<sup>24</sup> So the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<sup>25</sup> Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.

## Sons through Faith in Christ

<sup>26</sup> You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

<sup>27</sup> For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.

<sup>28</sup> There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

<sup>29</sup> And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.
