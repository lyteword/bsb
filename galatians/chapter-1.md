# Chapter 1

## Paul’s Greeting to the Galatians

**¹** Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—

**²** and all the brothers with me, To the churches of Galatia:

**³** Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,[^4478]

**⁴** who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

**⁵** to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

## No Other Gospel

**⁶** I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—

**⁷** which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.

**⁸** But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!

**⁹** As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse!

## Paul Preaches the Gospel

**¹⁰** Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.

**¹¹** For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man.[^4479]

**¹²** I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.

**¹³** For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.

**¹⁴** I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

**¹⁵** But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased

**¹⁶** to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,

**¹⁷** nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.

**¹⁸** Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas,[^4480] and I stayed with him fifteen days.

**¹⁹** But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.

**²⁰** I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie.

**²¹** Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

**²²** I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.

**²³** They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”

**²⁴** And they glorified God because of me.
