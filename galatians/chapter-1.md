# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead— 

<sup>2</sup> and all the brothers with me, To the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 

<sup>5</sup> to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>6</sup> I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 

<sup>7</sup> which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse! 

<sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse! 

<sup>10</sup> Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> For I certify to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man. 

<sup>12</sup> I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. 

<sup>14</sup> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased 

<sup>16</sup> to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood, 

<sup>17</sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. 

<sup>18</sup> Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother. 

<sup>20</sup> I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie. 

<sup>21</sup> Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

<sup>22</sup> I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 

<sup>23</sup> They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” 

<sup>24</sup> And they glorified God because of me.
