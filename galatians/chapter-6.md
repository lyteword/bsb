# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. 

<sup>2</sup> Carry one anotherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 

<sup>4</sup> Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else. 

<sup>5</sup> For each one should carry his own load. 

<sup>6</sup> Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor. 

<sup>7</sup> Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return. 

<sup>8</sup> The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 

<sup>9</sup> Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith. 

<sup>11</sup> See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand! 

<sup>12</sup> Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 

<sup>14</sup> But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 

<sup>15</sup> For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation. 

<sup>16</sup> Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God. 

<sup>17</sup> From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. 

<sup>18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
