# Chapter 6

## Carry One Another’s Burdens

**¹** Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.

**²** Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

**³** If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

**⁴** Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.

**⁵** For each one should carry his own load.

**⁶** Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.

**⁷** Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.

**⁸** The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.

**⁹** Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

**¹⁰** Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.

## Final Warnings and Blessings

**¹¹** See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!

**¹²** Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.

**¹³** For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.

**¹⁴** But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which [^4498] the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

**¹⁵** For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.

**¹⁶** Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.

**¹⁷** From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.

**¹⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
