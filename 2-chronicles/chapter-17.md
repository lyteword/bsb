## Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah

**(1 Kings 15:23–24)**

<sup>1</sup> Asa’s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.

<sup>2</sup> He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.

<sup>3</sup> Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways [^1779] of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,

<sup>4</sup> but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel.

<sup>5</sup> So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.

<sup>6</sup> And his heart took delight [^1780] in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.

<sup>7</sup> In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,

<sup>8</sup> accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.

<sup>9</sup> They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.

<sup>10</sup> And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.

<sup>11</sup> Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.

<sup>12</sup> Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah

<sup>13</sup> and kept vast supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of valor.

<sup>14</sup> These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: From Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor;

<sup>15</sup> next to him, Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000;

<sup>16</sup> and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor.

<sup>17</sup> From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him 200,000 armed with bows and shields;

<sup>18</sup> and next to him, Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed for battle.

<sup>19</sup> These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.

[^1779]: 17:3 Or in his early years he walked in the ways
[^1780]: 17:6 Or was exalted or was courageous
