# Chapter 27

## Jotham Reigns in Judah

**(2 Kings 15:32–38)**

**¹** Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerushah [^1824] daughter of Zadok.

**²** And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah [^1825] had done. In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved corruptly.

**³** Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel.

**⁴** He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.

**⁵** Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver,[^1826] ten thousand cors of wheat,[^1827] and ten thousand cors of barley.[^1828] They paid him the same in the second and third years.

**⁶** So Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.

**⁷** As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

**⁸** He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.

**⁹** And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.
