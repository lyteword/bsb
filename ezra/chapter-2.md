<sup>58</sup> The temple servants and descendants of the servants of Solomon numbered 392 in all. 

<sup>59</sup> The following came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but could not prove that their families were descended from Israel: 

<sup>60</sup> the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda, 652 in all. 

<sup>61</sup> And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai (who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name). 

<sup>62</sup> These men searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 

<sup>63</sup> The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim. 

<sup>64</sup> The whole assembly numbered 42,360, 

<sup>65</sup> in addition to their 7,337 menservants and maidservants, as well as their 200 male and female singers. 

<sup>66</sup> They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 

<sup>67</sup> 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. 

<sup>68</sup> When they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings to rebuild the house of God on its original site. 

<sup>69</sup> According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 darics of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly garments. 

<sup>70</sup> So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, along with some of the people, settled in their own towns; and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
