## Offerings by the Exiles

**(Exodus 38:21–31; Nehemiah 7:70–73)**

<sup>68</sup> When they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings to rebuild the house of God on its original site.

<sup>69</sup> According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 darics of gold,[^1892] 5,000 minas of silver,[^1893] and 100 priestly garments.

<sup>70</sup> So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, along with some of the people, settled in their own towns; and the rest of the Israelites [^1894] settled in their towns.
