# Chapter 6

## The Unrepentance of Israel and Judah

**¹** Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.

**²** After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.

**³** So let us know— let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.

**⁴** What shall I do with you, O Ephraim [^3301]? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes.

**⁵** Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth, and My judgments go forth like lightning.

**⁶** For I desire mercy, not sacrifice,[^3302] and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.

**⁷** But they, like Adam, have transgressed [^3303] the covenant; there they were unfaithful to Me.

**⁸** Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood.

**⁹** Like raiders who lie in ambush, so does a band of priests; they murder on the way to Shechem; surely they have committed atrocities.

**¹⁰** In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled.

**¹¹** Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.[^3304]
