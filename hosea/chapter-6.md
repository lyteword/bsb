# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds. 

<sup>2</sup> After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence. 

<sup>3</sup> So let us knowâ€” let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> What shall I do with you, O Ephraim ? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth, and My judgments go forth like lightning. 

<sup>6</sup> For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. 

<sup>7</sup> But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; there they were unfaithful to Me. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood. 

<sup>9</sup> Like raiders who lie in ambush, so does a band of priests; they murder on the way to Shechem; surely they have committed atrocities. 

<sup>10</sup> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled. 

<sup>11</sup> Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.
