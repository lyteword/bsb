# Chapter 10

## Retribution for Israel’s Sin

<sup>1</sup> Israel was a luxuriant vine, yielding fruit for himself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better he made the sacred pillars.

<sup>2</sup> Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.

<sup>3</sup> Surely now they will say, “We have no king, for we do not revere the LORD. What can a king do for us?”

<sup>4</sup> They speak mere words; with false oaths they make covenants. So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.

<sup>5</sup> The people of Samaria will fear for the calf of Beth-aven.[^3313] Indeed, its people will mourn over it with its idolatrous priests— those who rejoiced in its glory— for it has been taken from them into exile.

<sup>6</sup> Yes, it will be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king.[^3314] Ephraim [^3315] will be seized with shame; Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.[^3316]

<sup>7</sup> Samaria will be carried off with her king like a twig on the surface of the water.

<sup>8</sup> The high places of Aven [^3317] will be destroyed— it is the sin of Israel; thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”[^3318]

<sup>9</sup> Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. Did not the battle in Gibeah overtake the sons of iniquity?[^3319]

<sup>10</sup> I will chasten them when I please; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their double transgression.

<sup>11</sup> Ephraim is a well-trained heifer that loves to thresh; but I will place a yoke on her fair neck. I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, and Jacob will break the hard ground.

<sup>12</sup> Sow for yourselves righteousness and reap the fruit of loving devotion; break up your unplowed ground. For it is time to seek the LORD until He comes and sends righteousness upon you like rain.

<sup>13</sup> You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your mighty men,

<sup>14</sup> the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be demolished as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel in the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.

<sup>15</sup> Thus it will be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. When the day dawns, the king of Israel will be utterly cut off.
