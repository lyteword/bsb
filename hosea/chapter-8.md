# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Put the ram’s horn to your lips! An eagle looms over the house of the LORD, because the people have transgressed My covenant and rebelled against My law. 

<sup>2</sup> Israel cries out to Me, “O our God, we know You!” 

<sup>3</sup> But Israel has rejected good; an enemy will pursue him. 

<sup>4</sup> They set up kings, but not by Me. They make princes, but without My approval. With their silver and gold they make themselves idols, to their own destruction. 

<sup>5</sup> He has rejected your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence? 

<sup>6</sup> For this thing is from Israel— a craftsman made it, and it is not God. It will be broken to pieces, that calf of Samaria. 

<sup>7</sup> For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if it should produce, the foreigners would swallow it up. 

<sup>8</sup> Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like a worthless vessel. 

<sup>9</sup> For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey on its own. Ephraim has hired lovers. 

<sup>10</sup> Though they hire allies among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to diminish under the oppression of the king of princes. 

<sup>11</sup> Though Ephraim multiplied the altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning. 

<sup>12</sup> Though I wrote for them the great things of My law, they regarded them as something strange. 

<sup>13</sup> Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to Me, and though they eat the meat, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt. 

<sup>14</sup> Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has multiplied its fortified cities. But I will send fire upon their cities, and it will consume their citadels.
