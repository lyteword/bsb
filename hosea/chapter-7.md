# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> When I heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim will be exposed, as well as the crimes of Samaria. For they practice deceit and thieves break in; bandits raid in the streets. 

<sup>2</sup> But they fail to consider in their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds are all around them; they are before My face. 

<sup>3</sup> They delight the king with their evil, and the princes with their lies. 

<sup>4</sup> They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by a baker who needs not stoke the fire from the kneading to the rising of the dough. 

<sup>5</sup> The princes are inflamed with wine on the day of our king; so he joins hands with those who mock him. 

<sup>6</sup> For they prepare their heart like an oven while they lie in wait; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 

<sup>7</sup> All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls upon Me. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is an unturned cake. 

<sup>9</sup> Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not know. 

<sup>10</sup> Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the LORD their God; despite all this, they do not seek Him. 

<sup>11</sup> So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove— calling out to Egypt, then turning to Assyria. 

<sup>12</sup> As they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the air. I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together. 

<sup>13</sup> Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against Me! Though I would redeem them, they speak lies against Me. 

<sup>14</sup> They do not cry out to Me from their hearts when they wail upon their beds. They slash themselves for grain and new wine, but turn away from Me. 

<sup>15</sup> Although I trained and strengthened their arms, they plot evil against Me. 

<sup>16</sup> They turn, but not to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword for the cursing of their tongue; for this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
