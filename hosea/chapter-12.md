# Chapter 12

## A Reproof of Ephraim, Judah, and Jacob

<sup>1</sup> Ephraim [^3324] feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; he multiplies lies and violence; he makes a covenant with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.

<sup>2</sup> The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah. He will punish Jacob [^3325] according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.

<sup>3</sup> In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he wrestled with God.

<sup>4</sup> Yes, he struggled with the angel [^3326] and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor; he found Him at Bethel and spoke with Him there [^3327]—

<sup>5</sup> the LORD God of Hosts, the LORD is His name of renown.

<sup>6</sup> But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and always wait on your God.

<sup>7</sup> A merchant loves to defraud with dishonest scales in his hands.

<sup>8</sup> And Ephraim boasts: “How rich I have become! I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they can find in me no iniquity that is sinful.”

<sup>9</sup> But I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.

<sup>10</sup> I spoke through the prophets and multiplied their visions; I gave parables through the prophets.

<sup>11</sup> Is there iniquity in Gilead? They will surely come to nothing. Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.

<sup>12</sup> Jacob fled to the land of Aram [^3328] and Israel worked for a wife— for a wife he tended sheep.

<sup>13</sup> But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.

<sup>14</sup> Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his contempt.
