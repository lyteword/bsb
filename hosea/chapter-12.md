# Chapter 12

## A Reproof of Ephraim, Judah, and Jacob

**¹** Ephraim [^3324] feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; he multiplies lies and violence; he makes a covenant with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.

**²** The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah. He will punish Jacob [^3325] according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.

**³** In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he wrestled with God.

**⁴** Yes, he struggled with the angel [^3326] and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor; he found Him at Bethel and spoke with Him there [^3327]—

**⁵** the LORD God of Hosts, the LORD is His name of renown.

**⁶** But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and always wait on your God.

**⁷** A merchant loves to defraud with dishonest scales in his hands.

**⁸** And Ephraim boasts: “How rich I have become! I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they can find in me no iniquity that is sinful.”

**⁹** But I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.

**¹⁰** I spoke through the prophets and multiplied their visions; I gave parables through the prophets.

**¹¹** Is there iniquity in Gilead? They will surely come to nothing. Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.

**¹²** Jacob fled to the land of Aram [^3328] and Israel worked for a wife— for a wife he tended sheep.

**¹³** But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.

**¹⁴** Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his contempt.
