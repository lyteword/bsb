# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations, for you have played the harlot against your God; you have made love for hire on every threshing floor. 

<sup>2</sup> The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, and the new wine will fail them. 

<sup>3</sup> They will not remain in the land of the LORD; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria. 

<sup>4</sup> They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, and their sacrifices will not please Him, but will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat will be defiled. For their bread will be for themselves; it will not enter the house of the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> What will you do on the appointed day, on the day of the LORD’s feast? 

<sup>6</sup> For even if they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them and Memphis will bury them. Their precious silver will be taken over by thistles, and thorns will overrun their tents. 

<sup>7</sup> The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have arrived— let Israel know it. The prophet is called a fool, and the inspired man insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and hostility. 

<sup>8</sup> The prophet is Ephraim’s watchman, along with my God, yet the snare of the fowler lies on all his paths. Hostility is in the house of his God! 

<sup>9</sup> They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their guilt; He will punish their sins. 

<sup>10</sup> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the firstfruits of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to Shame; so they became as detestable as the thing they loved. 

<sup>11</sup> Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird, with no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. 

<sup>12</sup> Even if they raise their children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe be to them when I turn away from them! 

<sup>13</sup> I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a meadow. But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter. 

<sup>14</sup> Give them, O LORD— what will You give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up! 

<sup>15</sup> All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. 

<sup>16</sup> Ephraim is struck down; their root is withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay the darlings of their wombs. 

<sup>17</sup> My God will reject them because they have not obeyed Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
