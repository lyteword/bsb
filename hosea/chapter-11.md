# Chapter 11

## Out of Egypt I Called My Son

**(Matthew 2:13–15)**

**¹** When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.[^3320]

**²** But the more I called Israel, the farther they departed from Me.[^3321] They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.

**³** It was I who taught Ephraim [^3322] to walk, taking them by the arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.

**⁴** I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.

**⁵** Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?

**⁶** A sword will flash through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.

**⁷** My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.

## God’s Love for Israel

**⁸** How could I give you up, O Ephraim? How could I surrender you, O Israel? How could I make you like Admah? How could I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!

**⁹** I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man— the Holy One among you— and I will not come in wrath.

**¹⁰** They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.

**¹¹** They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.

**¹²** Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.[^3323]
