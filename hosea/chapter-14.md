# Chapter 14

## A Call to Repentance

**(Jeremiah 3:11–25; Zechariah 1:1–6)**

<sup>1</sup> Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled by your iniquity.

<sup>2</sup> Bring your confessions and return to the LORD. Say to Him: “Take away all our iniquity and receive us graciously, that we may present the fruit of our lips.[^3334]

<sup>3</sup> Assyria will not save us, nor will we ride on horses. We will never again say, ‘Our gods!’ to the work of our own hands. For in You the fatherless find compassion.”

## A Promise of God’s Blessing

<sup>4</sup> I will heal their apostasy; I will freely love them, for My anger has turned away from them.

<sup>5</sup> I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.

<sup>6</sup> His shoots will sprout, and his splendor will be like the olive tree, his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.

<sup>7</sup> They will return and dwell in his shade; they will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.

<sup>8</sup> O Ephraim,[^3335] what have I to do anymore with idols? It is I who answer and watch over him. I am like a flourishing cypress;[^3336] your fruit comes from Me.

<sup>9</sup> Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them but the rebellious stumble in them.
