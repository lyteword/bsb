# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom: 

<sup>2</sup> Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and encourage with every form of patient instruction. 

<sup>3</sup> For the time will come when men will not tolerate sound doctrine, but with itching ears they will gather around themselves teachers to suit their own desires. 

<sup>4</sup> So they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 

<sup>5</sup> But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 

<sup>6</sup> For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand. 

<sup>7</sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 

<sup>8</sup> From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that dayâ€”and not only to me, but to all who crave His appearing. 

<sup>9</sup> Make every effort to come to me quickly, 

<sup>10</sup> because Demas, in his love of this world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 

<sup>11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is useful to me in the ministry. 

<sup>12</sup> Tychicus, however, I have sent to Ephesus. 

<sup>13</sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. 

<sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 

<sup>15</sup> You too should beware of him, for he has vigorously opposed our message. 

<sup>16</sup> At my first defense, no one stood with me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be charged against them. 

<sup>17</sup> But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles would hear it. So I was delivered from the mouth of the lion. 

<sup>18</sup> And the Lord will rescue me from every evil action and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>19</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, as well as the household of Onesiphorus. 

<sup>20</sup> Erastus has remained at Corinth, and Trophimus I left sick in Miletus. 

<sup>21</sup> Make every effort to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
