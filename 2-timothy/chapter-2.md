# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>2</sup> And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well. 

<sup>3</sup> Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>4</sup> A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him. 

<sup>5</sup> Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules. 

<sup>6</sup> The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops. 

<sup>7</sup> Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel, 

<sup>9</sup> for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained! 

<sup>10</sup> For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 

<sup>11</sup> This is a trustworthy saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him; 

<sup>12</sup> if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us; 

<sup>13</sup> if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself. 

<sup>14</sup> Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin. 

<sup>15</sup> Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth. 

<sup>16</sup> But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness, 

<sup>17</sup> and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 

<sup>18</sup> who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some. 

<sup>19</sup> Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.” 

<sup>20</sup> A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for honorable use, but others are for common use. 

<sup>21</sup> So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit, he will be a vessel for honor: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work. 

<sup>22</sup> Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

<sup>23</sup> But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling. 

<sup>24</sup> And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing. 

<sup>25</sup> He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>26</sup> Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.
