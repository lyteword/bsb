# Chapter 2

## Grace and Perseverance

**(Hebrews 12:1–3)**

**¹** You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

**²** And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well.

**³** Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

**⁴** A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him.

**⁵** Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.

**⁶** The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops.

**⁷** Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things.

**⁸** Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel,

**⁹** for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained!

**¹⁰** For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.

**¹¹** This is a trustworthy saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him;

**¹²** if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;

**¹³** if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.

## The Lord’s Approved Workman

**¹⁴** Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God [^4579] to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.

**¹⁵** Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth.

**¹⁶** But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness,

**¹⁷** and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

**¹⁸** who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some.

**¹⁹** Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,”[^4580] and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”

**²⁰** A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for honorable use, but others are for common use.

**²¹** So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit,[^4581] he will be a vessel for honor: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.

**²²** Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

**²³** But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling.

**²⁴** And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing.

**²⁵** He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.

**²⁶** Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.

[^4579]: 2:14 SBL, BYZ, and TR the Lord
[^4580]: 2:19 Numbers 16:5 (see also LXX)
