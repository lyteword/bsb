# Chapter 3

## Evil in the Last Days

**¹** But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.

**²** For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,

**³** unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, without love of good,

**⁴** traitorous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

**⁵** having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!

**⁶** They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions,

**⁷** who are always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.

**⁸** Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,[^4582] so also these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and disqualified from the faith.

**⁹** But they will not advance much further. For just like Jannes and Jambres, their folly will be plain to everyone.

## All Scripture Is God-Breathed

**(Hebrews 4:12–16)**

**¹⁰** You, however, have observed my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my perseverance,

**¹¹** my persecutions, and the sufferings that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.

**¹²** Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,

**¹³** while evil men and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

**¹⁴** But as for you, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you have learned them.

**¹⁵** From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

**¹⁶** All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,

**¹⁷** so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
