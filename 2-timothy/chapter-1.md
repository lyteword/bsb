# Chapter 1

## Paul’s Greeting to Timothy

**(1 Timothy 1:1–2)**

**¹** Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,

**²** To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Faithfulness under Persecution

**(Matthew 10:16–25)**

**³** I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as did my forefathers, as I constantly remember you night and day in my prayers.

**⁴** Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.

**⁵** I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is in you as well.

**⁶** For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

**⁷** For God has not given us a spirit of fear,[^4573] but of power, love, and self-control.

**⁸** So do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me, His prisoner. Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God.

**⁹** He has saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began.[^4574]

**¹⁰** And now He has revealed this grace through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the gospel,

**¹¹** to which I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.

**¹²** For this reason, even though I suffer as I do, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him [^4575] for that day.

## Holding to Sound Teaching

**¹³** Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching [^4576] you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

**¹⁴** Guard the treasure entrusted to you,[^4577] with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

**¹⁵** You know that everyone in the Province of Asia [^4578] has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.

**¹⁶** May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he has often refreshed me and was unashamed of my chains.

**¹⁷** Indeed, when he arrived in Rome, he searched diligently until he found me.

**¹⁸** May the Lord grant Onesiphorus His mercy on that day. You know very well how much he ministered to me in Ephesus.
