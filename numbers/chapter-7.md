## Offerings of Dedication

<sup>1</sup> On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils.

<sup>2</sup> And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, presented an offering. These men were the tribal leaders who had supervised the registration.

<sup>3</sup> They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two leaders—and presented them before the tabernacle.

<sup>4</sup> And the LORD said to Moses,

<sup>5</sup> “Accept these gifts from them, that they may be used in the work of the Tent of Meeting. And give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”

<sup>6</sup> So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.

<sup>7</sup> He gave the Gershonites two carts and four oxen, as their service required,

<sup>8</sup> and he gave the Merarites four carts and eight oxen, as their service required, all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.

<sup>9</sup> But he did not give any to the Kohathites, since they were to carry on their shoulders the holy objects for which they were responsible.

<sup>10</sup> When the altar was anointed, the leaders approached with their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.

<sup>11</sup> And the LORD said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to present his offering for the dedication of the altar.”
