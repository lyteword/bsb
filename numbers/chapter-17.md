# Chapter 17

## Aaron’s Staff Buds

**¹** And the LORD said to Moses,

**²** “Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff,

**³** and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.

**⁴** Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony,[^577] where I meet with you.

**⁵** The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.”

**⁶** So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them.

**⁷** Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.

**⁸** The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds.

**⁹** Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff.

**¹⁰** The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.”

**¹¹** So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him.

**¹²** Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost!

**¹³** Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to perish?”

[^577]: 17:4 The Testimony refers to the stone tablets in the ark of the covenant inscribed with the Ten Commandments; also in verse 10.
