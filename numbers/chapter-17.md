# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff, 

<sup>3</sup> and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe. 

<sup>4</sup> Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you. 

<sup>5</sup> The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.” 

<sup>6</sup> So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them. 

<sup>7</sup> Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony. 

<sup>8</sup> The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds. 

<sup>9</sup> Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.” 

<sup>11</sup> So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. 

<sup>12</sup> Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost! 

<sup>13</sup> Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to perish?”
