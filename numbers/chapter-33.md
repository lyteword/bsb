## Forty-Two Journeys of the Israelites

<sup>1</sup> These are the journeys of the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt by their divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.

<sup>2</sup> At the LORD’s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey. These are the stages listed by their starting points:

<sup>3</sup> On the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the Passover, the Israelites set out from Rameses. They marched out defiantly [^633] in full view of all the Egyptians,

<sup>4</sup> who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods.

<sup>5</sup> The Israelites set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.

<sup>6</sup> They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.

<sup>7</sup> They set out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon, and they camped near Migdol.

<sup>8</sup> They set out from Pi-hahiroth [^634] and crossed through the sea, into the wilderness, and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.

<sup>37</sup> They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom.

<sup>38</sup> At the LORD’s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first day of the fifth month, in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt.

<sup>39</sup> Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.

<sup>49</sup> And there on the plains of Moab they camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim.[^639]

## Instructions for Occupying Canaan

<sup>50</sup> On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,

<sup>51</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

<sup>52</sup> you must drive out before you all the inhabitants of the land, destroy all their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high places.

<sup>53</sup> You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.

<sup>54</sup> And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.

<sup>55</sup> But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle.

<sup>56</sup> And then I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.”
