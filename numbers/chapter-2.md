**¹⁶** The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Reuben is 151,450; they shall set out second.

**¹⁷** In the middle of the camps, the Tent of Meeting is to travel with the camp of the Levites. They are to set out in the order they encamped, each in his own place under his standard.

**¹⁸** On the west side, the divisions of Ephraim are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud,

**²³** and his division numbers 35,400.

**²⁴** The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Ephraim is 108,100; they shall set out third.

**²⁵** On the north side, the divisions of Dan are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai,

**³²** These are the Israelites, numbered according to their families. The total of those counted in the camps, by their divisions, was 603,550.

**³³** But the Levites were not counted among the other Israelites, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

**³⁴** So the Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; they camped under their standards in this way and set out in the same way, each man with his clan and his family.
