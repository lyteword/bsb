# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> “Command the Israelites and say to them: See that you present to Me at its appointed time the food for My offerings by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Me. 

<sup>3</sup> And tell them that this is the offering made by fire you are to present to the LORD as a regular burnt offering each day: two unblemished year-old male lambs. 

<sup>4</sup> Offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight, 

<sup>5</sup> along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed olives. 

<sup>6</sup> This is a regular burnt offering established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> The drink offering accompanying each lamb shall be a quarter hin. Pour out the offering of fermented drink to the LORD in the sanctuary area. 

<sup>8</sup> And offer the second lamb at twilight, with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning. It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 

<sup>9</sup> On the Sabbath day, present two unblemished year-old male lambs, accompanied by a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as well as a drink offering. 

<sup>10</sup> This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>11</sup> At the beginning of every month, you are to present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished, 

<sup>12</sup> along with three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with the ram, 

<sup>13</sup> and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering with each lamb. This is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD. 

<sup>14</sup> Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine with each bull, a third of a hin with the ram, and a quarter hin with each lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon throughout the year. 

<sup>15</sup> In addition to the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering. 

<sup>16</sup> The fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD’s Passover. 

<sup>17</sup> On the fifteenth day of this month, there shall be a feast; for seven days unleavened bread is to be eaten. 

<sup>18</sup> On the first day there is to be a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 

<sup>19</sup> Present to the LORD an offering made by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished. 

<sup>20</sup> The grain offering shall consist of fine flour mixed with oil; offer three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 

<sup>21</sup> and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs. 

<sup>22</sup> Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 

<sup>23</sup> You are to present these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering. 

<sup>24</sup> Offer the same food each day for seven days as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It is to be offered with its drink offering and the regular burnt offering. 

<sup>25</sup> On the seventh day you shall hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 

<sup>26</sup> On the day of firstfruits, when you present an offering of new grain to the LORD during the Feast of Weeks, you are to hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work. 

<sup>27</sup> Present a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, 

<sup>28</sup> together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil—three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram, 

<sup>29</sup> and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs. 

<sup>30</sup> Include one male goat to make atonement for you. 

<sup>31</sup> Offer them with their drink offerings in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering. The animals must be unblemished.
