# Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> “Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these boundaries: 

<sup>3</sup> Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea, 

<sup>4</sup> cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon, 

<sup>5</sup> where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea. 

<sup>6</sup> Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west. 

<sup>7</sup> Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor, 

<sup>8</sup> and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad, 

<sup>9</sup> continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north. 

<sup>10</sup> And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham, 

<sup>11</sup> then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth. 

<sup>12</sup> Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.” 

<sup>13</sup> So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes. 

<sup>14</sup> For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance. 

<sup>15</sup> These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.” 

<sup>16</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>17</sup> “These are the names of the men who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 

<sup>18</sup> Appoint one leader from each tribe to distribute the land. 

<sup>19</sup> These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah; 

<sup>20</sup> Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon; 

<sup>21</sup> Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin; 

<sup>22</sup> Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan; 

<sup>23</sup> Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph; 

<sup>24</sup> Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim; 

<sup>25</sup> Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun; 

<sup>26</sup> Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar; 

<sup>27</sup> Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher; 

<sup>28</sup> and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.” 

<sup>29</sup> These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
