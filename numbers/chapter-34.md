# Chapter 34

## The Boundaries of Canaan

**(Genesis 15:8–21)**

**¹** Then the LORD said to Moses,

**²** “Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these boundaries:

**³** Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea,[^640]

**⁴** cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim,[^641] continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon,

**⁵** where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea.[^642]

**⁶** Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west.

**⁷** Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor,

**⁸** and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad,

**⁹** continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north.

**¹⁰** And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham,

**¹¹** then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth.[^643]

**¹²** Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”

**¹³** So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes.

**¹⁴** For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance.

**¹⁵** These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”

## Leaders to Divide the Land

**¹⁶** Then the LORD said to Moses,

**¹⁷** “These are the names of the men who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.

**¹⁸** Appoint one leader from each tribe to distribute the land.

**¹⁹** These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;

**²⁰** Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;

**²¹** Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;

**²²** Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;

**²³** Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;

**²⁴** Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim;

**²⁵** Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;

**²⁶** Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;

**²⁷** Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;

**²⁸** and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”

**²⁹** These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
