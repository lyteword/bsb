# Chapter 24

## The Oil for the Lamps

**(Exodus 27:20–21)**

**¹** Then the LORD said to Moses,

**²** “Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.

**³** Outside the veil of the Testimony [^515] in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come.

**⁴** He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.

## The Showbread

**(Exodus 25:23–30; Exodus 37:10–16)**

**⁵** You are also to take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf,[^516]

**⁶** and set them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the LORD.

**⁷** And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, a food offering to the LORD.

**⁸** Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a permanent covenant.

**⁹** It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD—his portion forever.”

## Punishment for Blasphemy

**¹⁰** Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.

**¹¹** The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)

**¹²** They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.

**¹³** Then the LORD said to Moses,

**¹⁴** “Take the blasphemer [^517] outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him.

**¹⁵** And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.

**¹⁶** Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death; the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.

## An Eye for an Eye

**(Matthew 5:38–48)**

**¹⁷** And if a man takes the life of anyone else, he must surely be put to death.

**¹⁸** Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life.

**¹⁹** If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:

**²⁰** fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.[^518] Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him.

**²¹** Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.

**²²** You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’”

**²³** Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
