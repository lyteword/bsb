# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>3</sup> You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs. 

<sup>4</sup> You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>5</sup> Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her. 

<sup>8</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father. 

<sup>9</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere. 

<sup>10</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family. 

<sup>11</sup> You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister. 

<sup>12</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative. 

<sup>13</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative. 

<sup>14</sup> You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt. 

<sup>15</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sexual relations with her. 

<sup>16</sup> You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother. 

<sup>17</sup> You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved. 

<sup>18</sup> You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive. 

<sup>19</sup> You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period. 

<sup>20</sup> You must not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife and thus defile yourself with her. 

<sup>21</sup> You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. 

<sup>22</sup> You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination. 

<sup>23</sup> You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion. 

<sup>24</sup> Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves. 

<sup>25</sup> Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants. 

<sup>26</sup> But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you. 

<sup>27</sup> For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled. 

<sup>28</sup> So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you. 

<sup>29</sup> Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people. 

<sup>30</sup> You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.”
