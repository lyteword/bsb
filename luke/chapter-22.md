# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, 

<sup>2</sup> and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people. 

<sup>3</sup> Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve. 

<sup>4</sup> And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them. 

<sup>5</sup> They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 

<sup>6</sup> Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd. 

<sup>7</sup> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. 

<sup>8</sup> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.” 

<sup>9</sup> “Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked. 

<sup>10</sup> He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters, 

<sup>11</sup> and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’ 

<sup>12</sup> And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.” 

<sup>13</sup> So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover. 

<sup>14</sup> When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles. 

<sup>15</sup> And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering. 

<sup>16</sup> For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 

<sup>17</sup> After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves. 

<sup>18</sup> For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.” 

<sup>19</sup> And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 

<sup>20</sup> In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you. 

<sup>21</sup> Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table. 

<sup>22</sup> Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.” 

<sup>23</sup> Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this. 

<sup>24</sup> A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest. 

<sup>25</sup> So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors. 

<sup>26</sup> But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 

<sup>27</sup> For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves. 

<sup>28</sup> You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials. 

<sup>29</sup> And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me, 

<sup>30</sup> so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 

<sup>31</sup> Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat. 

<sup>32</sup> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 

<sup>33</sup> “Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.” 

<sup>34</sup> But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.” 

<sup>35</sup> Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered. 

<sup>36</sup> “Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. 

<sup>37</sup> For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.” 

<sup>38</sup> So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered. 

<sup>39</sup> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him. 

<sup>40</sup> When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” 

<sup>41</sup> And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, 

<sup>42</sup> “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.” 

<sup>43</sup> Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him. 

<sup>44</sup> And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. 

<sup>46</sup> “Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.” 

<sup>47</sup> While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him. 

<sup>48</sup> But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 

<sup>49</sup> Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” 

<sup>50</sup> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. 

<sup>51</sup> But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him. 

<sup>52</sup> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw? 

<sup>53</sup> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.” 

<sup>54</sup> Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance. 

<sup>55</sup> When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 

<sup>56</sup> A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said. 

<sup>57</sup> But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said. 

<sup>58</sup> A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” 

<sup>59</sup> About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.” 

<sup>60</sup> “Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. 

<sup>61</sup> And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.” 

<sup>62</sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly. 

<sup>63</sup> The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him. 

<sup>64</sup> They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?” 

<sup>65</sup> And they said many other blasphemous things against Him. 

<sup>66</sup> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said, 

<sup>67</sup> “If You are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe. 

<sup>68</sup> And if I ask you a question, you will not answer. 

<sup>69</sup> But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 

<sup>70</sup> So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.” 

<sup>71</sup> “Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”
