# Chapter 24

## The Resurrection

**(Matthew 28:1–10; Mark 16:1–8; John 20:1–9)**

**¹** On the first day of the week,[^4005] very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.

**²** They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,

**³** but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

**⁴** While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.

**⁵** As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?

**⁶** He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:

**⁷** ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’”

**⁸** Then they remembered His words.

**⁹** And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.

**¹⁰** It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.

**¹¹** But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.

**¹²** Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.

## The Road to Emmaus

**(Mark 16:12–13)**

**¹³** That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles [^4006] from Jerusalem.

**¹⁴** They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.

**¹⁵** And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.

**¹⁶** But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.

**¹⁷** He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” They stood still, with sadness on their faces.

**¹⁸** One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”

**¹⁹** “What things?” He asked. “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.

**²⁰** Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.

**²¹** But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.

**²²** Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,

**²³** but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.

**²⁴** Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”

**²⁵** Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

**²⁶** Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”

**²⁷** And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.

**²⁸** As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.

**²⁹** But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them.

**³⁰** While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.

**³¹** Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.

**³²** They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”

**³³** And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together

**³⁴** and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”

**³⁵** Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.

## Jesus Appears to the Disciples

**(John 20:19–23; 1 John 1:1–4)**

**³⁶** While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”

**³⁷** But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.

**³⁸** “Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts?

**³⁹** Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”

**⁴⁰** And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.

**⁴¹** While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”

**⁴²** So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,[^4007]

**⁴³** and He took it and ate it in front of them.

**⁴⁴** Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”

**⁴⁵** Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.

**⁴⁶** And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,

**⁴⁷** and in His name repentance and[^4008] forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.

**⁴⁸** You are witnesses of these things.

**⁴⁹** And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”

## The Ascension

**(Mark 16:19–20; Acts 1:6–11)**

**⁵⁰** When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

**⁵¹** While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.

**⁵²** And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

**⁵³** praising God continually in the temple.
