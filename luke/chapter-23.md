# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.” 

<sup>3</sup> So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. 

<sup>4</sup> Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” 

<sup>5</sup> But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.” 

<sup>6</sup> When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 

<sup>7</sup> And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time. 

<sup>8</sup> When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle. 

<sup>9</sup> Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer. 

<sup>10</sup> Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him. 

<sup>11</sup> And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies. 

<sup>13</sup> Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 

<sup>14</sup> and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him. 

<sup>15</sup> Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death. 

<sup>16</sup> Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”
