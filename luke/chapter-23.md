# Chapter 23

## Jesus before Pilate

**(Matthew 27:11–14; John 18:28–40)**

<sup>1</sup> Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.

<sup>2</sup> And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.”

<sup>3</sup> So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.

<sup>4</sup> Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”

<sup>5</sup> But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.”

## Jesus before Herod

<sup>6</sup> When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

<sup>7</sup> And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time.

<sup>8</sup> When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle.

<sup>9</sup> Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer.

<sup>10</sup> Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him.

<sup>11</sup> And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate.

<sup>12</sup> That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies.

## The Crowd Chooses Barabbas

**(Matthew 27:15–23; Mark 15:6–11)**

<sup>13</sup> Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,

<sup>14</sup> and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him.

<sup>15</sup> Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death.

<sup>16</sup> Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”[^3990]

<sup>18</sup> But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”

<sup>19</sup> (Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)

<sup>20</sup> Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again,

<sup>21</sup> but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”

<sup>22</sup> A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.”

<sup>23</sup> But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor [^3991] prevailed.

<sup>24</sup> So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met.

<sup>25</sup> As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over to their will.

## The Crucifixion

**(Psalms 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Mark 15:21–32; John 19:16–27)**

<sup>26</sup> As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.

<sup>27</sup> A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him.

<sup>28</sup> But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

<sup>29</sup> Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’

<sup>30</sup> At that time ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!”’[^3992]

<sup>31</sup> For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

<sup>32</sup> Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.

<sup>33</sup> When they came to the place called The Skull,[^3993] they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.

<sup>34</sup> Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”[^3994] And they divided up His garments by casting lots.[^3995]

<sup>35</sup> The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him,[^3996] saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”

<sup>36</sup> The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine.[^3997]

<sup>37</sup> “If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!”

<sup>38</sup> Above Him was posted an inscription:[^3998] THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<sup>39</sup> One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!”

<sup>40</sup> But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?

<sup>41</sup> We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”

<sup>42</sup> Then he said, “Jesus, remember me [^3999] when You come into Your kingdom!”

<sup>43</sup> And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”

## The Death of Jesus

**(Psalms 31:1–24; Matthew 27:45–56; Mark 15:33–41; John 19:28–30)**

<sup>44</sup> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.[^4000]

<sup>45</sup> The sun was darkened,[^4001] and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.

<sup>46</sup> Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.”[^4002] And when He had said this, He breathed His last.

<sup>47</sup> When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man.[^4003]”

<sup>48</sup> And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts.

<sup>49</sup> But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things.

## The Burial of Jesus

**(Isaiah 53:9–12; Matthew 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; John 19:38–42)**

<sup>50</sup> Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man,

<sup>51</sup> who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God.

<sup>52</sup> He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.

<sup>53</sup> Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid.

<sup>54</sup> It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning.[^4004]

<sup>55</sup> The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed.

<sup>56</sup> Then they returned to prepare spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.
