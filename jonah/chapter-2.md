# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God, 

<sup>2</sup> saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me. 

<sup>4</sup> At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’ 

<sup>5</sup> The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head. 

<sup>6</sup> To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God! 

<sup>7</sup> As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion. 

<sup>9</sup> But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!” 

<sup>10</sup> And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
