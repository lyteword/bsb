# Chapter 2

## Jonah’s Prayer

**¹** From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,

**²** saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.

**³** For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me.

**⁴** At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’

**⁵** The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.

**⁶** To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!

**⁷** As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.

**⁸** Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.[^3400]

**⁹** But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!”

**¹⁰** And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.

[^3400]: 2:8 Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.
