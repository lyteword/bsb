# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Woe is me! For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave. 

<sup>2</sup> The godly man has perished from the earth; there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; they hunt one another with a net. 

<sup>3</sup> Both hands are skilled at evil; the prince and the judge demand a bribe. When the powerful utters his evil desire, they all conspire together. 

<sup>4</sup> The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is sharper than a hedge of thorns. The day for your watchmen has come, the day of your visitation. Now is the time of their confusion. 

<sup>5</sup> Do not rely on a friend; do not trust in a companion. Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms. 

<sup>6</sup> For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies are the members of his own household. 

<sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. 

<sup>8</sup> Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light. 

<sup>9</sup> Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the rage of the LORD, until He argues my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> Then my enemy will see and will be covered with shame— she who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will see her; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets. 

<sup>11</sup> The day for rebuilding your walls will come— the day for extending your boundary. 

<sup>12</sup> On that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates, from sea to sea and mountain to mountain. 

<sup>13</sup> Then the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the fruit of their deeds. 

<sup>14</sup> Shepherd with Your staff Your people, the flock of Your inheritance. They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 

<sup>15</sup> As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show My wonders. 

<sup>16</sup> Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their might. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf. 

<sup>17</sup> They will lick the dust like a snake, like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will crawl from their holes in the presence of the LORD our God; they will tremble in fear of You. 

<sup>18</sup> Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance— who does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in loving devotion? 

<sup>19</sup> He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast out all our sins into the depths of the sea. 

<sup>20</sup> You will show faithfulness to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from the days of old.
