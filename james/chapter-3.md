# Chapter 3

## Taming the Tongue

**(Psalms 64:1–10)**

<sup>1</sup> Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.

<sup>2</sup> We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.

<sup>3</sup> When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide the whole animal.

<sup>4</sup> Consider ships as well. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot is inclined.

<sup>5</sup> In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts of great things. Consider how small a spark sets a great forest ablaze.

<sup>6</sup> The tongue also is a fire, a world of wickedness among the parts of the body. It pollutes the whole person, sets the course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.[^4691]

<sup>7</sup> All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,

<sup>8</sup> but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

<sup>9</sup> With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.

<sup>10</sup> Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be!

<sup>11</sup> Can both fresh water and salt water [^4692] flow from the same spring?

<sup>12</sup> My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring [^4693] produce fresh water.

## The Wisdom from Above

<sup>13</sup> Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good conduct, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.

<sup>14</sup> But if you harbor bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast in it or deny the truth.

<sup>15</sup> Such wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.

<sup>16</sup> For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.

<sup>17</sup> But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.

<sup>18</sup> Peacemakers who sow in peace reap the fruit of righteousness.[^4694]

[^4691]: 3:6 Greek Gehenna
[^4692]: 3:11 Literally Can both fresh and bitter
[^4693]: 3:12 Literally Neither can salt
[^4694]: 3:18 Literally But the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those making peace.
