# Chapter 4

## A Warning against Pride

<sup>1</sup> What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?[^4695]

<sup>2</sup> You crave what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.

<sup>3</sup> And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures.

<sup>4</sup> You adulteresses![^4696] Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself [^4697] an enemy of God.

<sup>5</sup> Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit [^4698] He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?

<sup>6</sup> But He gives us more grace. This is why it says: “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”[^4699]

## Drawing Near to God

<sup>7</sup> Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

<sup>8</sup> Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

<sup>9</sup> Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.

<sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.

<sup>11</sup> Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.

<sup>12</sup> There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?

## Do Not Boast about Tomorrow

**(Proverbs 27:1)**

<sup>13</sup> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make a profit.”

<sup>14</sup> You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

<sup>15</sup> Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”

<sup>16</sup> As it is, you boast in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.

<sup>17</sup> Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.
