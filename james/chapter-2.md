# Chapter 2

## A Warning against Favoritism

<sup>1</sup> My brothers, as you hold out your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism.

<sup>2</sup> Suppose a man comes into your meeting [^4680] wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.

<sup>3</sup> If you lavish attention on the man in fine clothes and say, “Here is a seat of honor,” but say to the poor man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”

<sup>4</sup> have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

<sup>5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom He promised those who love Him?

<sup>6</sup> But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?

<sup>7</sup> Are they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which you have been called?[^4681]

<sup>8</sup> If you really fulfill the royal law stated in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”[^4682] you are doing well.

<sup>9</sup> But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.

<sup>10</sup> Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.

<sup>11</sup> For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,”[^4683] also said, “Do not murder.”[^4684] If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

<sup>12</sup> Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.

<sup>13</sup> For judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

## Faith and Works

**(Galatians 3:1–9)**

<sup>14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?

<sup>15</sup> Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.

<sup>16</sup> If one of you tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does not provide for his physical needs, what good is that?

<sup>17</sup> So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action,[^4685] is dead.

<sup>18</sup> But someone will say, “You have faith and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

<sup>19</sup> You believe that God is one.[^4686] Good for you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.

<sup>20</sup> O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?[^4687]

<sup>21</sup> Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

<sup>22</sup> You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith was perfected by what he did.

<sup>23</sup> And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”[^4688] and he was called a friend of God.[^4689]

<sup>24</sup> As you can see, a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone.

<sup>25</sup> In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies [^4690] and sent them off on another route?

<sup>26</sup> As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
