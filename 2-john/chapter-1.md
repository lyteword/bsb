# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth— 

<sup>2</sup> because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love. 

<sup>4</sup> I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us. 

<sup>5</sup> And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. 

<sup>6</sup> And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love. 

<sup>7</sup> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. 

<sup>8</sup> Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded. 

<sup>9</sup> Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son. 

<sup>10</sup> If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him. 

<sup>11</sup> Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds. 

<sup>12</sup> I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. 

<sup>13</sup> The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
