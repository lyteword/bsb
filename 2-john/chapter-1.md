# Chapter 1

## A Greeting from the Elder

**(3 John 1:1–4)**

**¹** The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—

**²** because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:

**³** Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love.

## Walking in the Truth

**(John 8:30–47)**

**⁴** I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.

**⁵** And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.

**⁶** And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.

## Beware of Deceivers

**⁷** For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.

**⁸** Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for,[^4778] but that you may be fully rewarded.

**⁹** Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.

**¹⁰** If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.

**¹¹** Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.

## Conclusion

**(3 John 1:13–14)**

**¹²** I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face,[^4779] so that our joy may be complete.

**¹³** The children of your elect sister send you greetings.[^4780]

[^4778]: 1:8 NE and WH what you have worked for
[^4779]: 1:12 Literally mouth to mouth
[^4780]: 1:13 BYZ and TR include Amen.
