# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready, 

<sup>3</sup> for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man? 

<sup>4</sup> For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men? 

<sup>5</sup> What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role. 

<sup>6</sup> I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. 

<sup>7</sup> So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 

<sup>8</sup> He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor. 

<sup>9</sup> For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building. 

<sup>10</sup> By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds. 

<sup>11</sup> For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

<sup>12</sup> If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, 

<sup>13</sup> his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work. 

<sup>14</sup> If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward. 

<sup>15</sup> If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames. 

<sup>16</sup> Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? 

<sup>17</sup> If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. 

<sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise. 

<sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.” 

<sup>20</sup> And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” 

<sup>21</sup> Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours, 

<sup>22</sup> whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you, 

<sup>23</sup> and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
