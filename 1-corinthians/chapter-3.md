# Chapter 3

## God’s Fellow Workers

**(Hebrews 5:11–14)**

**¹** Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ.

**²** I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready,

**³** for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man?

**⁴** For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?

**⁵** What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.

**⁶** I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.

**⁷** So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.

**⁸** He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose,[^4393] and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.

**⁹** For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.

## Christ Our Foundation

**(Isaiah 28:14–22; Ephesians 2:19–22; 1 Peter 2:1–8)**

**¹⁰** By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds.

**¹¹** For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

**¹²** If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,

**¹³** his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.

**¹⁴** If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.

**¹⁵** If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames.

## God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom

**(Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 6:18–20)**

**¹⁶** Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in [^4394] you?

**¹⁷** If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.

**¹⁸** Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise.

**¹⁹** For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”[^4395]

**²⁰** And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”[^4396]

**²¹** Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours,

**²²** whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas [^4397] or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,

**²³** and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
