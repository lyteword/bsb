# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal. 

<sup>2</sup> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 

<sup>3</sup> If I give all I possess to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body, but have not love, I gain nothing. 

<sup>4</sup> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 

<sup>5</sup> It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs. 

<sup>6</sup> Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth. 

<sup>7</sup> It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 

<sup>8</sup> Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed. 

<sup>9</sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 

<sup>10</sup> but when the perfect comes, the partial passes away. 

<sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways. 

<sup>12</sup> Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. 

<sup>13</sup> And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.
