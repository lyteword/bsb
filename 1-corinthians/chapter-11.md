# Chapter 11

## Roles in Worship

**¹** You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.

**²** Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.

**³** But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.

**⁴** Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.

**⁵** And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved.

**⁶** If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.

**⁷** A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.

**⁸** For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.

**⁹** Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.

**¹⁰** For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on [^4421] her head, because of the angels.

**¹¹** In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.

**¹²** For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.

**¹³** Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

**¹⁴** Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,

**¹⁵** but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.

**¹⁶** If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.

## Sharing in the Lord’s Supper

**(Matthew 26:20–30; Mark 14:17–26; Luke 22:14–23)**

**¹⁷** In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.

**¹⁸** First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.

**¹⁹** And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved.

**²⁰** Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat.

**²¹** For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal.[^4422] While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.

**²²** Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!

**²³** For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread,

**²⁴** and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you;[^4423] do this in remembrance of Me.”

**²⁵** In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

**²⁶** For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.

**²⁷** Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the [^4424] body and blood of the Lord.

**²⁸** Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.

**²⁹** For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body [^4425] eats and drinks judgment on himself.

**³⁰** That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.

**³¹** Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment.

**³²** But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.

**³³** So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

**³⁴** If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.

[^4421]: 11:10 Or have authority over
[^4422]: 11:21 Literally each one takes first his own meal.
[^4423]: 11:24 BYZ and TR which is broken for you
[^4424]: 11:27 Or will be responsible for the
[^4425]: 11:29 BYZ and TR the body of the Lord
