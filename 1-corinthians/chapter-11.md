# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 

<sup>5</sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved. 

<sup>6</sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. 

<sup>7</sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. 

<sup>8</sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. 

<sup>9</sup> Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 

<sup>10</sup> For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 

<sup>11</sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 

<sup>12</sup> For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 

<sup>13</sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 

<sup>14</sup> Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 

<sup>15</sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 

<sup>16</sup> If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God. 

<sup>17</sup> In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good. 

<sup>18</sup> First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 

<sup>19</sup> And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved. 

<sup>20</sup> Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat. 

<sup>21</sup> For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal. While one remains hungry, another gets drunk. 

<sup>22</sup> Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not! 

<sup>23</sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread, 

<sup>24</sup> and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” 

<sup>25</sup> In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” 

<sup>26</sup> For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes. 

<sup>27</sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. 

<sup>29</sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. 

<sup>30</sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 

<sup>31</sup> Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment. 

<sup>32</sup> But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. 

<sup>33</sup> So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 

<sup>34</sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.
