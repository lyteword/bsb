# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>2</sup> On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed. 

<sup>3</sup> Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me. 

<sup>5</sup> After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia. 

<sup>6</sup> Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. 

<sup>7</sup> For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 

<sup>8</sup> But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 

<sup>9</sup> because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me. 

<sup>10</sup> If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am. 

<sup>11</sup> No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers. 

<sup>12</sup> Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. 

<sup>13</sup> Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong. 

<sup>14</sup> Do everything in love. 

<sup>15</sup> You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers, 

<sup>16</sup> to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. 

<sup>17</sup> I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. 

<sup>18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men. 

<sup>19</sup> The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. 

<sup>20</sup> All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

<sup>21</sup> This greeting is in my own handâ€”Paul. 

<sup>22</sup> If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord! 

<sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 

<sup>24</sup> My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
