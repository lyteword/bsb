## Immorality Rebuked

**(Leviticus 20:10–21; Proverbs 5:1–23)**

<sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans: A man has his father’s wife.

<sup>2</sup> And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed from your fellowship the man who did this?

<sup>3</sup> Although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.

<sup>4</sup> When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus [^4399] and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of the Lord Jesus,

<sup>5</sup> hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.[^4400]

<sup>6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough?

<sup>7</sup> Get rid of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.

## Expel the Immoral Brother

<sup>9</sup> I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.

<sup>10</sup> I was not including the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.

<sup>11</sup> But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.

<sup>12</sup> What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?

<sup>13</sup> God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”[^4401]

[^4399]: 5:4 Or In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled
[^4400]: 5:5 BYZ and TR the Lord Jesus
[^4401]: 5:13 Literally Expel the evil from among you; Deuteronomy 13:5, 17:7, 19:19, 21:21, 22:21, 22:24, and 24:7
