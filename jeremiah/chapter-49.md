# Chapter 49

<sup>1</sup> Concerning the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: “Has Israel no sons? Is he without heir? Why then has Milcom taken possession of Gad? Why have his people settled in their cities? 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a heap of ruins, and its villages will be burned. Then Israel will drive out their dispossessors, says the LORD. 

<sup>3</sup> Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed; cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run back and forth within your walls, for Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials. 

<sup>4</sup> Why do you boast of your valleys— your valleys so fruitful, O faithless daughter? You trust in your riches and say, ‘Who can come against me?’ 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I am about to bring terror upon you, declares the Lord GOD of Hosts, from all those around you. You will each be driven headlong, with no one to regather the fugitives. 

<sup>6</sup> Yet afterward I will restore the Ammonites from captivity,” declares the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Concerning Edom, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed? 

<sup>8</sup> Turn and run! Lie low, O dwellers of Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him. 

<sup>9</sup> If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings? Were thieves to come in the night, would they not steal only what they wanted? 

<sup>10</sup> But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, and he will be unable to conceal himself. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors, and he will be no more. 

<sup>11</sup> Abandon your orphans; I will preserve their lives. Let your widows trust in Me.” 

<sup>12</sup> For this is what the LORD says: “If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, can you possibly remain unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you must drink it too. 

<sup>13</sup> For by Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse, and all her cities will be in ruins forever.” 

<sup>14</sup> I have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent to the nations: “Assemble yourselves to march against her! Rise up for battle!” 

<sup>15</sup> “For behold, I will make you small among nations, despised among men. 

<sup>16</sup> The terror you cause and the pride of your heart have deceived you, O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks, O occupiers of the mountain summit. Though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down,” 

<sup>17</sup> “Edom will become an object of horror. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds. 

<sup>18</sup> As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,” says the LORD, “no one will dwell there; no man will abide there. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture. For in an instant I will chase Edom from her land. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? For who is like Me, and who can challenge Me? What shepherd can stand against Me?” 

<sup>20</sup> Therefore hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Edom and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman: Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away; certainly their pasture will be made desolate because of them. 

<sup>21</sup> At the sound of their fall the earth will quake; their cry will resound to the Red Sea. 

<sup>22</sup> Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor. 

<sup>23</sup> Concerning Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard a bad report; they are agitated like the sea; their anxiety cannot be calmed. 

<sup>24</sup> Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee. Panic has gripped her; anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor. 

<sup>25</sup> How is the city of praise not forsaken, the town that brings Me joy? 

<sup>26</sup> For her young men will fall in the streets, and all her warriors will be silenced in that day,” 

<sup>27</sup> “I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; it will consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad.” 

<sup>28</sup> Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated, this is what the LORD says: “Rise up, advance against Kedar, and destroy the people of the east! 

<sup>29</sup> They will take their tents and flocks, their tent curtains and all their goods. They will take their camels for themselves. They will shout to them: ‘Terror is on every side!’ 

<sup>30</sup> Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, O residents of Hazor,” declares the LORD, “for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you. 

<sup>31</sup> Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, one that dwells securely,” declares the LORD. “They have no gates or bars; they live alone. 

<sup>32</sup> Their camels will become plunder, and their large herds will be spoil. I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples; I will bring calamity on them from all sides,” 

<sup>33</sup> “Hazor will become a haunt for jackals, a desolation forever. No one will dwell there; no man will abide there.” 

<sup>34</sup> This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah. 

<sup>35</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold, I will shatter Elam’s bow, the mainstay of their might. 

<sup>36</sup> I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will not be a nation to which Elam’s exiles will not go. 

<sup>37</sup> So I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who seek their lives. I will bring disaster upon them, even My fierce anger,” declares the LORD. “I will send out the sword after them until I finish them off. 

<sup>38</sup> I will set My throne in Elam, and destroy its king and officials,” 

<sup>39</sup> “Yet in the last days, I will restore Elam from captivity,”
