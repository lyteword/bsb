# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, 

<sup>2</sup> then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose. 

<sup>3</sup> Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves. 

<sup>4</sup> Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. 

<sup>5</sup> Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>6</sup> Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, 

<sup>7</sup> but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness. 

<sup>8</sup> And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death— even death on a cross. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name above all names, 

<sup>10</sup> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 

<sup>11</sup> and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. 

<sup>13</sup> For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose. 

<sup>14</sup> Do everything without complaining or arguing, 

<sup>15</sup> so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world 

<sup>16</sup> as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. 

<sup>17</sup> But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. 

<sup>18</sup> So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. 

<sup>19</sup> Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing. 

<sup>20</sup> I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs. 

<sup>21</sup> For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>22</sup> But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel. 

<sup>23</sup> So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me. 

<sup>24</sup> And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon. 

<sup>25</sup> But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs. 

<sup>26</sup> For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 

<sup>27</sup> He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. 

<sup>28</sup> Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious. 

<sup>29</sup> Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him, 

<sup>30</sup> because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.
