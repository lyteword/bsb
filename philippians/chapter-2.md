# Chapter 2

## One in Christ

**(Ephesians 2:11–18)**

**¹** Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,

**²** then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose.

**³** Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.

**⁴** Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.

## The Mind of Christ

**(Isaiah 52:13–15)**

**⁵** Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:

**⁶** Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,[^4521]

**⁷** but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness.

**⁸** And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death— even death on a cross.

**⁹** Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name above all names,

**¹⁰** that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

**¹¹** and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

## Lights in the World

**(Matthew 5:13–16)**

**¹²** Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.

**¹³** For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.

**¹⁴** Do everything without complaining or arguing,

**¹⁵** so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation,[^4522] in which you shine as lights in the world

**¹⁶** as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.

**¹⁷** But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.

**¹⁸** So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.

## Timothy and Epaphroditus

**(1 Corinthians 16:10–12)**

**¹⁹** Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing.

**²⁰** I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs.

**²¹** For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.

**²²** But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.

**²³** So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me.

**²⁴** And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.

**²⁵** But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.

**²⁶** For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.

**²⁷** He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.

**²⁸** Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.

**²⁹** Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,

**³⁰** because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.
