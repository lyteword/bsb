# Chapter 1

## Greetings from Paul and Timothy

**(Colossians 1:1–2; Philemon 1:1–3)**

**¹** Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:

**²** Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Thanksgiving and Prayer

**(1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)**

**³** I thank my God every time I remember you.

**⁴** In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy,

**⁵** because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,

**⁶** being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

**⁷** It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me.

**⁸** God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

**⁹** And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,

**¹⁰** so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

**¹¹** filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

## Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel

**(James 1:2–12)**

**¹²** Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.

**¹³** As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard [^4516] and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.

**¹⁴** And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word [^4517] without fear.

**¹⁵** It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

**¹⁶** The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.[^4518]

**¹⁷** The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.

**¹⁸** What then is the issue?[^4519] Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,

**¹⁹** because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance.

**²⁰** I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

## To Live Is Christ

**²¹** For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

**²²** But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know.

**²³** I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.

**²⁴** But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.

**²⁵** Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,

**²⁶** so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.

## Worthy of the Gospel

**²⁷** Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending together as one [^4520] for the faith of the gospel,

**²⁸** without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God.

**²⁹** For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,

**³⁰** since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
