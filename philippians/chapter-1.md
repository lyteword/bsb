# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons: 

<sup>2</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> I thank my God every time I remember you. 

<sup>4</sup> In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy, 

<sup>5</sup> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 

<sup>6</sup> being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>7</sup> It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me. 

<sup>8</sup> God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>9</sup> And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 

<sup>10</sup> so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 

<sup>11</sup> filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 

<sup>12</sup> Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel. 

<sup>13</sup> As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 

<sup>14</sup> And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear. 

<sup>15</sup> It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 

<sup>16</sup> The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 

<sup>17</sup> The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains. 

<sup>18</sup> What then is the issue? Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 

<sup>19</sup> because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance. 

<sup>20</sup> I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 

<sup>21</sup> For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 

<sup>22</sup> But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know. 

<sup>23</sup> I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed. 

<sup>24</sup> But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 

<sup>25</sup> Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 

<sup>26</sup> so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me. 

<sup>27</sup> Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending side by side for the faith of the gospel, 

<sup>28</sup> without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God. 

<sup>29</sup> For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him, 

<sup>30</sup> since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
