# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. 

<sup>2</sup> Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh! 

<sup>3</sup> For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— 

<sup>4</sup> though I myself could have such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 

<sup>5</sup> circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; 

<sup>6</sup> as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless. 

<sup>7</sup> But whatever was gain to me I count as loss for the sake of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> More than that, I count all things as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 

<sup>9</sup> and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith. 

<sup>10</sup> I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to Him in His death, 

<sup>11</sup> and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead. 

<sup>12</sup> Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 

<sup>13</sup> Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 

<sup>14</sup> I press on toward the goal to win the prize of God’s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>15</sup> All of us who are mature should embrace this point of view. And if you think differently about some issue, God will reveal this to you as well. 

<sup>16</sup> Nevertheless, we must live up to what we have already attained. 

<sup>17</sup> Join one another in following my example, brothers, and carefully observe those who walk according to the pattern we set for you. 

<sup>18</sup> For as I have often told you before, and now say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 

<sup>19</sup> Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things. 

<sup>20</sup> But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>21</sup> who, by the power that enables Him to subject all things to Himself, will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body.
