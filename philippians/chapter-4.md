# Chapter 4

## Rejoice in the Lord

<sup>1</sup> Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you must stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.

<sup>2</sup> I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.

<sup>3</sup> Yes, and I ask you, my true yokefellow,[^4524] to help these women who have contended at my side for the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!

<sup>5</sup> Let your gentleness be apparent to all. The Lord is near.

<sup>6</sup> Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

<sup>7</sup> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

<sup>8</sup> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think on these things.

<sup>9</sup> Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.

## The Generosity of the Philippians

**(2 Corinthians 8:1–15)**

<sup>10</sup> Now I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.

<sup>11</sup> I am not saying this out of need, for I have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances.

<sup>12</sup> I know how to live humbly, and I know how to abound. In any and every situation I have learned the secret of being filled and being hungry, of having plenty and having need.

<sup>13</sup> I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.[^4525]

<sup>14</sup> Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my affliction.

<sup>15</sup> And as you Philippians know, in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church but you partnered with me in the matter of giving and receiving.

<sup>16</sup> For even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs again and again.

<sup>17</sup> Not that I am seeking a gift, but I am looking for the fruit that may be credited to your account.

<sup>18</sup> I have all I need and more, now that I have received your gifts from Epaphroditus. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.

<sup>19</sup> And my God will supply all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.

<sup>20</sup> To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Final Greetings

**(Ephesians 6:21–24; 2 Timothy 4:19–22)**

<sup>21</sup> Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you greetings.

<sup>22</sup> All the saints send you greetings, especially those from the household of Caesar.

<sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.[^4526]

[^4524]: 4:3 Or I ask you, loyal Syzygus
[^4525]: 4:13 NA, SBL, NE, and WH in the One who gives me strength. BYZ and TR in Christ who gives me strength.
[^4526]: 4:23 BYZ and TR include Amen.
