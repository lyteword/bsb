# Chapter 4

## Testing the Spirits

**¹** Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world.

**²** By this you will know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,

**³** and every spirit that does not confess Jesus [^4767] is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and which is already in the world at this time.

**⁴** You, little children, are from God and have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.

**⁵** They are of the world. That is why they speak from the world’s perspective, and the world listens to them.

**⁶** We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit [^4768] of truth and the spirit of deception.

## Love Comes from God

**⁷** Beloved, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

**⁸** Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.

**⁹** This is how God’s love was revealed among us: God sent His one and only [^4769] Son into the world, so that we might live through Him.

**¹⁰** And love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice [^4770] for our sins.

**¹¹** Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

**¹²** No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us.

**¹³** By this we know that we remain in Him, and He in us: He has given us of His Spirit.

**¹⁴** And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son to be the Savior of the world.

**¹⁵** If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

**¹⁶** And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him.

**¹⁷** In this way, love has been perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment; for in this world we are just like Him.

**¹⁸** There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.

**¹⁹** We love [^4771] because He first loved us.

**²⁰** If anyone says, “I love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.

**²¹** And we have this commandment from Him: Whoever loves God must love his brother as well.
