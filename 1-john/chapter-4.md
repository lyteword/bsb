# Chapter 4

## Testing the Spirits

<sup>1</sup> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world.

<sup>2</sup> By this you will know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,

<sup>3</sup> and every spirit that does not confess Jesus [^4767] is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and which is already in the world at this time.

<sup>4</sup> You, little children, are from God and have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.

<sup>5</sup> They are of the world. That is why they speak from the world’s perspective, and the world listens to them.

<sup>6</sup> We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit [^4768] of truth and the spirit of deception.

## Love Comes from God

<sup>7</sup> Beloved, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.

<sup>8</sup> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.

<sup>9</sup> This is how God’s love was revealed among us: God sent His one and only [^4769] Son into the world, so that we might live through Him.

<sup>10</sup> And love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice [^4770] for our sins.

<sup>11</sup> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

<sup>12</sup> No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us.

<sup>13</sup> By this we know that we remain in Him, and He in us: He has given us of His Spirit.

<sup>14</sup> And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son to be the Savior of the world.

<sup>15</sup> If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.

<sup>16</sup> And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him.

<sup>17</sup> In this way, love has been perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment; for in this world we are just like Him.

<sup>18</sup> There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.

<sup>19</sup> We love [^4771] because He first loved us.

<sup>20</sup> If anyone says, “I love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.

<sup>21</sup> And we have this commandment from Him: Whoever loves God must love his brother as well.
