# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children, 

<sup>2</sup> and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God. 

<sup>3</sup> But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed. 

<sup>4</sup> Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving. 

<sup>5</sup> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 

<sup>6</sup> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. 

<sup>7</sup> Therefore do not be partakers with them. 

<sup>8</sup> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, 

<sup>9</sup> for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. 

<sup>10</sup> Test and prove what pleases the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 

<sup>12</sup> For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 

<sup>13</sup> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself. 

<sup>14</sup> So it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” 

<sup>15</sup> Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, 

<sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

<sup>17</sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. 

<sup>18</sup> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord, 

<sup>20</sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>21</sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 

<sup>22</sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior. 

<sup>24</sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 

<sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her 

<sup>26</sup> to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 

<sup>27</sup> and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless. 

<sup>28</sup> In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 

<sup>29</sup> Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church. 

<sup>30</sup> For we are members of His body. 

<sup>31</sup> “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” 

<sup>32</sup> This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church. 

<sup>33</sup> Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
