# Chapter 5

## Imitators of God

**¹** Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children,

**²** and walk in love, just as Christ loved us [^4510] and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God.

**³** But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed.

**⁴** Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving.

**⁵** For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

**⁶** Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.

**⁷** Therefore do not be partakers with them.

## Children of Light

**⁸** For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,

**⁹** for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.

**¹⁰** Test and prove what pleases the Lord.

**¹¹** Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

**¹²** For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.

**¹³** But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,[^4511] for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself.

**¹⁴** So it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”

**¹⁵** Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,

**¹⁶** redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

**¹⁷** Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.

**¹⁸** Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.

**¹⁹** Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,

**²⁰** always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Wives and Husbands

**(Song 1:1–17; 1 Peter 3:1–7)**

**²¹** Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.[^4512]

**²²** Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.

**²³** For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior.

**²⁴** Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

**²⁵** Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her

**²⁶** to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,

**²⁷** and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.

**²⁸** In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

**²⁹** Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.

**³⁰** For we are members of His body.[^4513]

**³¹** “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”[^4514]

**³²** This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church.

**³³** Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
