# Chapter 1

## Paul’s Greeting to the Ephesians

**(Acts 19:8–12; Revelation 2:1–7)**

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus,[^4499] the faithful in Christ Jesus:

<sup>2</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Spiritual Blessings

**(Romans 8:28–34)**

<sup>3</sup> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.

<sup>4</sup> For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love

<sup>5</sup> He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,

<sup>6</sup> to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.

<sup>7</sup> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace

<sup>8</sup> that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.

<sup>9</sup> And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ

<sup>10</sup> as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.

<sup>11</sup> In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,

<sup>12</sup> in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.

<sup>13</sup> And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,

<sup>14</sup> who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.

## Spiritual Wisdom

**(1 Corinthians 2:6–16)**

<sup>15</sup> For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,

<sup>16</sup> I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,

<sup>17</sup> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.

<sup>18</sup> I ask that the eyes of your heart [^4500] may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,

<sup>19</sup> and the surpassing greatness of His power to us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength,

<sup>20</sup> which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,

<sup>21</sup> far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.

<sup>22</sup> And God put everything under His feet and made Him head over everything for the church,

<sup>23</sup> which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
