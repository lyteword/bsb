# Chapter 3

## The Mystery of the Gospel

**¹** For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...[^4502]

**²** Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,

**³** that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.

**⁴** In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

**⁵** which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.

**⁶** This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.

**⁷** I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.

**⁸** Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,

**⁹** and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship [^4503] of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.

**¹⁰** His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

**¹¹** according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.

**¹²** In Him and through faith in Him [^4504] we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.

**¹³** So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.

## Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians

**¹⁴** ... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father,[^4505]

**¹⁵** from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.

**¹⁶** I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,

**¹⁷** so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,

**¹⁸** will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth

**¹⁹** of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

**²⁰** Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,

**²¹** to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
