# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles... 

<sup>2</sup> Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 

<sup>3</sup> that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 

<sup>4</sup> In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 

<sup>5</sup> which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. 

<sup>6</sup> This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>7</sup> I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power. 

<sup>8</sup> Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 

<sup>9</sup> and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 

<sup>10</sup> His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 

<sup>11</sup> according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence. 

<sup>13</sup> So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. 

<sup>14</sup> ... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 

<sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. 

<sup>16</sup> I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being, 

<sup>17</sup> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love, 

<sup>18</sup> will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth 

<sup>19</sup> of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 

<sup>20</sup> Now to Him who is able to do so much more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us, 

<sup>21</sup> to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
