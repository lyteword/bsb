# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven final plagues, with which the wrath of God is completed. 

<sup>2</sup> And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God, 

<sup>3</sup> and they sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations! 

<sup>4</sup> Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed.” 

<sup>5</sup> After this I looked, and the temple—the tabernacle of the Testimony—was opened in heaven. 

<sup>6</sup> And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean and bright linen and girded with golden sashes around their chests. 

<sup>7</sup> Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 

<sup>8</sup> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
