# Chapter 22

## The River of Life

**¹** Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb

**²** down the middle of the main street of the city. On either side of the river stood a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

**³** No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city, and His servants will worship Him.

**⁴** They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.

**⁵** There will be no more night in the city, and they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun. For the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.

## Jesus Is Coming

**⁶** Then the angel said to me, “These words are faithful and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show His servants what must soon [^4848] take place.”

**⁷** “Behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of prophecy in this book.[^4849]”

**⁸** And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things.

**⁹** But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”

**¹⁰** Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book, because the time is near.

**¹¹** Let the unrighteous continue to be unrighteous, and the vile continue to be vile; let the righteous continue to practice righteousness, and the holy continue to be holy.”

**¹²** “Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me, to give to each one according to what he has done.

**¹³** I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”

**¹⁴** Blessed are those who wash their robes,[^4850] so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by its gates.

**¹⁵** But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

**¹⁶** “I, Jesus, have sent My angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.”

**¹⁷** The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let the one who hears say, “Come!” And let the one who is thirsty come, and the one who desires the water of life drink freely.

## Nothing May Be Added or Removed

**¹⁸** I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.

**¹⁹** And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book.

**²⁰** He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
