# Chapter 2

## Teaching Sound Doctrine

**¹** But as for you, speak the things that are consistent with sound doctrine.

**²** Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and perseverance.

**³** Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers or addicted to much wine, but teachers of good.

**⁴** In this way they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,

**⁵** to be self-controlled, pure, managers of their households, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be discredited.

**⁶** In the same way, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.

**⁷** In everything, show yourself to be an example by doing good works. In your teaching show integrity, dignity,

**⁸** and wholesome speech that is above reproach, so that anyone who opposes us will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.

**⁹** Slaves are to submit to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,

**¹⁰** not stealing from them, but showing all good faith, so that in every respect they will adorn the teaching about God our Savior.

## God’s Grace Brings Salvation

**¹¹** For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to everyone.

**¹²** It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age,

**¹³** as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.

**¹⁴** He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.

**¹⁵** Speak these things as you encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
