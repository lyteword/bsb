# Chapter 2

## Teaching Sound Doctrine

<sup>1</sup> But as for you, speak the things that are consistent with sound doctrine.

<sup>2</sup> Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and perseverance.

<sup>3</sup> Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers or addicted to much wine, but teachers of good.

<sup>4</sup> In this way they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,

<sup>5</sup> to be self-controlled, pure, managers of their households, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be discredited.

<sup>6</sup> In the same way, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.

<sup>7</sup> In everything, show yourself to be an example by doing good works. In your teaching show integrity, dignity,

<sup>8</sup> and wholesome speech that is above reproach, so that anyone who opposes us will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.

<sup>9</sup> Slaves are to submit to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,

<sup>10</sup> not stealing from them, but showing all good faith, so that in every respect they will adorn the teaching about God our Savior.

## God’s Grace Brings Salvation

<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to everyone.

<sup>12</sup> It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age,

<sup>13</sup> as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.

<sup>14</sup> He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.

<sup>15</sup> Speak these things as you encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
