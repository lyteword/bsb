# Chapter 1

## Paul’s Greeting to Titus

**(2 Corinthians 8:16–24)**

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,

<sup>2</sup> in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.[^4585]

<sup>3</sup> In His own time He has made His word evident in the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

<sup>4</sup> To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

## Appointing Elders on Crete

**(1 Timothy 3:1–7; 1 Peter 5:1–4)**

<sup>5</sup> The reason I left you in Crete was that you would set in order what was unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.

<sup>6</sup> An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife,[^4586] having children who are believers and who are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination.

<sup>7</sup> As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach—not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money.

<sup>8</sup> Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.

<sup>9</sup> He must hold firmly to the faithful word as it was taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute those who contradict it.

## Correcting False Teachers

**(1 Timothy 1:3–11)**

<sup>10</sup> For many are rebellious and full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision,

<sup>11</sup> who must be silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire households and teach things they should not.

<sup>12</sup> As one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”[^4587]

<sup>13</sup> This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith

<sup>14</sup> and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected the truth.

<sup>15</sup> To the pure, all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.

<sup>16</sup> They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.

[^4585]: 1:2 Literally before times eternal
