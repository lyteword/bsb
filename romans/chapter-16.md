# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea. 

<sup>2</sup> Welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her with anything she may need from you. For she has been a great help to many people, including me. 

<sup>3</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 

<sup>4</sup> who have risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them. 

<sup>5</sup> Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my beloved Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia. 

<sup>6</sup> Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you. 

<sup>7</sup> Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow countrymen and fellow prisoners. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was. 

<sup>8</sup> Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys. 

<sup>10</sup> Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. 

<sup>11</sup> Greet Herodion, my fellow countryman. Greet those from the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, women who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my beloved Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me as well. 

<sup>14</sup> Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them. 

<sup>15</sup> Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them. 

<sup>16</sup> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send you greetings. 

<sup>17</sup> Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Turn away from them. 

<sup>18</sup> For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive. 

<sup>19</sup> Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil. 

<sup>20</sup> The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

<sup>21</sup> Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow countrymen. 

<sup>22</sup> I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> Gaius, who has hosted me and all the church, sends you greetings. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you greetings, as does our brother Quartus.
