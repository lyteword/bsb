# Chapter 9

## Paul’s Concern for the Jews

<sup>1</sup> I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.

<sup>2</sup> I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.

<sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood,

<sup>4</sup> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.

<sup>5</sup> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise![^4318] Amen.

## God’s Sovereign Choice

**(Genesis 25:19–28; Malachi 1:1–5)**

<sup>6</sup> It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.

<sup>7</sup> Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”[^4319]

<sup>8</sup> So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring.

<sup>9</sup> For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”[^4320]

<sup>10</sup> Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac.

<sup>11</sup> Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand,

<sup>12</sup> not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”[^4321]

<sup>13</sup> So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”[^4322]

<sup>14</sup> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not!

<sup>15</sup> For He says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”[^4323]

<sup>16</sup> So then, it does not depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.

<sup>17</sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”[^4324]

<sup>18</sup> Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.

<sup>19</sup> One of you will say to me, “Then why does God still find fault? For who can resist His will?”

<sup>20</sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it, “Why did You make me like this?”[^4325]

<sup>21</sup> Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?

<sup>22</sup> What if God, intending to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction?

<sup>23</sup> What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory—

<sup>24</sup> including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?

<sup>25</sup> As He says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘My People’ who are not My people, and I will call her ‘My Beloved’ who is not My beloved,”[^4326]

<sup>26</sup> and, “It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”[^4327]

<sup>27</sup> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.

<sup>28</sup> For the Lord will carry out His sentence on the earth thoroughly and decisively.”[^4328]

<sup>29</sup> It is just as Isaiah foretold: “Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.”[^4329]

## Israel’s Unbelief

<sup>30</sup> What then will we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;

<sup>31</sup> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.

<sup>32</sup> Why not? Because their pursuit was not by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,

<sup>33</sup> as it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense;[^4330] and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”[^4331]
