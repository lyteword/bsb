# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 

<sup>2</sup> God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel: 

<sup>3</sup> “Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”? 

<sup>4</sup> And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” 

<sup>5</sup> In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 

<sup>6</sup> And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. 

<sup>7</sup> What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, 

<sup>8</sup> as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, to this very day.” 

<sup>9</sup> And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution to them. 

<sup>10</sup> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.” 

<sup>11</sup> I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous. 

<sup>12</sup> But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! 

<sup>13</sup> I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 

<sup>14</sup> in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them. 

<sup>15</sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 

<sup>16</sup> If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches. 

<sup>17</sup> Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root, 

<sup>18</sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 

<sup>19</sup> You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” 

<sup>20</sup> That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 

<sup>21</sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either. 

<sup>22</sup> Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 

<sup>24</sup> For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! 

<sup>25</sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. 

<sup>26</sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will remove godlessness from Jacob. 

<sup>27</sup> And this is My covenant with them when I take away their sins.” 

<sup>28</sup> Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs. 

<sup>29</sup> For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable. 

<sup>30</sup> Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience, 

<sup>31</sup> so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you. 

<sup>32</sup> For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone. 

<sup>33</sup> O, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and untraceable His ways! 

<sup>34</sup> “Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?” 

<sup>35</sup> “Who has first given to God, that God should repay him?” 

<sup>36</sup> For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.
