# Chapter 2

## God’s Righteous Judgment

**(Psalms 75:1–10)**

<sup>1</sup> You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.

<sup>2</sup> And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.

<sup>3</sup> So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?

<sup>4</sup> Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?

<sup>5</sup> But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.

<sup>6</sup> God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”[^4289]

<sup>7</sup> To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.

<sup>8</sup> But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.

<sup>9</sup> There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;

<sup>10</sup> but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.

<sup>11</sup> For God does not show favoritism.

<sup>12</sup> All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.

<sup>13</sup> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.

<sup>14</sup> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.

<sup>15</sup> So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them

<sup>16</sup> on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus,[^4290] as proclaimed by my gospel.

## The Jews and the Law

<sup>17</sup> Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;

<sup>18</sup> if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;

<sup>19</sup> if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,

<sup>20</sup> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—

<sup>21</sup> you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?

<sup>22</sup> You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?

<sup>23</sup> You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?

<sup>24</sup> As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”[^4291]

<sup>25</sup> Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

<sup>26</sup> If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?

<sup>27</sup> The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.

<sup>28</sup> A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.

<sup>29</sup> No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.
