## Instructions to Elders

**(1 Timothy 3:1–7; Titus 1:5–9)**

<sup>1</sup> As a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s sufferings, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders [^4729] among you:

<sup>2</sup> Be shepherds of God’s flock that is among you, watching over them [^4730] not out of compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you;[^4731] not out of greed, but out of eagerness;

<sup>3</sup> not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.

<sup>4</sup> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.

## Cast Your Cares on Him

<sup>5</sup> Young men, in the same way, submit yourselves to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”[^4732]

<sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, so that in due time He may exalt you.

<sup>7</sup> Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.

<sup>8</sup> Be sober-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

<sup>9</sup> Resist him, standing firm in your faith and in the knowledge that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.

## Benediction and Farewell

<sup>10</sup> And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ,[^4733] will Himself restore you, secure you, strengthen you, and establish you.

<sup>11</sup> To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen.

<sup>12</sup> Through Silvanus,[^4734] whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.

<sup>13</sup> The church in Babylon,[^4735] chosen together with you, sends you greetings, as does my son Mark.

<sup>14</sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.[^4736]
