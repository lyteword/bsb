# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you. 

<sup>2</sup> For you are fully aware that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 

<sup>3</sup> While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 

<sup>4</sup> But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief. 

<sup>5</sup> For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 

<sup>6</sup> So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober. 

<sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 

<sup>8</sup> But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation. 

<sup>9</sup> For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>10</sup> He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him. 

<sup>11</sup> Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing. 

<sup>12</sup> But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who work diligently among you, who preside over you in the Lord and give you instruction. 

<sup>13</sup> In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another. 

<sup>14</sup> And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient with everyone. 

<sup>15</sup> Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people. 

<sup>16</sup> Rejoice at all times. 

<sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing. 

<sup>18</sup> Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>19</sup> Do not extinguish the Spirit. 

<sup>20</sup> Do not treat prophecies with contempt, 

<sup>21</sup> but test all things. Hold fast to what is good. 

<sup>22</sup> Abstain from every form of evil. 

<sup>23</sup> Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>24</sup> The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it. 

<sup>25</sup> Brothers, pray for us as well. 

<sup>26</sup> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 

<sup>27</sup> I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers. 

<sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
