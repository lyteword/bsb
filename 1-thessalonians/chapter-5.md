# Chapter 5

## The Day of the Lord

**(Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 2 Peter 3:8–13)**

**¹** Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you.

**²** For you are fully aware that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

**³** While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.

**⁴** But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief.

**⁵** For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness.

**⁶** So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.

**⁷** For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.

**⁸** But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation.

**⁹** For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.

**¹⁰** He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.

**¹¹** Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing.

## Christian Living

**¹²** But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who work diligently among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.

**¹³** In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another.

**¹⁴** And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.

**¹⁵** Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.

**¹⁶** Rejoice at all times.

**¹⁷** Pray without ceasing.

**¹⁸** Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

**¹⁹** Do not extinguish the Spirit.

**²⁰** Do not treat prophecies with contempt,

**²¹** but test all things. Hold fast to what is good.

**²²** Abstain from every form of evil.

## Final Blessings and Instructions

**²³** Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless [^4548] at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**²⁴** The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.

**²⁵** Brothers, pray for us as well.

**²⁶** Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

**²⁷** I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.

**²⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.[^4549]

[^4548]: 5:23 Or may your spirit, soul, and body be kept entirely blameless
[^4549]: 5:28 BYZ and TR include Amen.
