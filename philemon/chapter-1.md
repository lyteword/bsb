# Chapter 1

## Greetings from Paul and Timothy

**(Philippians 1:1–2; Colossians 1:1–2)**

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker,

<sup>2</sup> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your [^4590] house:

<sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Philemon’s Faith and Love

<sup>4</sup> I always thank my God, remembering you in my prayers,

<sup>5</sup> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.

<sup>6</sup> I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.

<sup>7</sup> I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.

## Paul’s Appeal for Onesimus

<sup>8</sup> So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper,

<sup>9</sup> I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well.

<sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my child Onesimus,[^4591] whose father I became while I was in chains.

<sup>11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.

<sup>12</sup> I am sending back to you him who is my very heart.

<sup>13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel.

<sup>14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will.

<sup>15</sup> For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good—

<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord.

<sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.

<sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.

<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.

<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me have some benefit [^4592] from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

<sup>21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.

<sup>22</sup> In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

## Additional Greetings

<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,

<sup>24</sup> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.

<sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.[^4593]
