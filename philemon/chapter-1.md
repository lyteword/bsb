# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker, 

<sup>2</sup> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your house: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>4</sup> I always thank my God, remembering you in my prayers, 

<sup>5</sup> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. 

<sup>6</sup> I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ. 

<sup>7</sup> I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. 

<sup>8</sup> So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper, 

<sup>9</sup> I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well. 

<sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I became while I was in chains. 

<sup>11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. 

<sup>12</sup> I am sending back to you him who is my very heart. 

<sup>13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 

<sup>14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will. 

<sup>15</sup> For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good— 

<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. 

<sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account. 

<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self. 

<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. 

<sup>21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. 

<sup>22</sup> In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 

<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings, 

<sup>24</sup> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 

<sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
