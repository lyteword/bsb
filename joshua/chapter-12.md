# Chapter 12

## The Kings Defeated East of the Jordan

<sup>1</sup> Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites struck down and whose lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:

<sup>2</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites), that is, half of Gilead,

<sup>3</sup> as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth [^830] to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea [^831]), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.

<sup>4</sup> And Og king of Bashan,[^832] one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.

<sup>5</sup> He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

<sup>6</sup> Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down and given their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

## The Kings Defeated West of the Jordan

<sup>7</sup> And these are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir (according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance

<sup>8</sup> the hill country, the foothills,[^833] the Arabah, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev—the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):
