# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. 

<sup>2</sup> He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house. 

<sup>3</sup> For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 

<sup>4</sup> And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. 

<sup>5</sup> Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later. 

<sup>6</sup> But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope of which we boast. 

<sup>7</sup> Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear His voice, 

<sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness, 

<sup>9</sup> where your fathers tested and tried Me, and for forty years saw My works. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I was angry with that generation, and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known My ways.’ 

<sup>11</sup> So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’” 

<sup>12</sup> See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God. 

<sup>13</sup> But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. 

<sup>14</sup> We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first. 

<sup>15</sup> As it has been said: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion.” 

<sup>16</sup> For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? 

<sup>17</sup> And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 

<sup>18</sup> And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? 

<sup>19</sup> So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter.
