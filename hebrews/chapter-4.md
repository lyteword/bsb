# Chapter 4

## The Sabbath Rest

**(Genesis 2:1–3; Exodus 16:22–30)**

**¹** Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it.

**²** For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.[^4618]

**³** Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said: “So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’”[^4619] And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world.

**⁴** For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.”[^4620]

**⁵** And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.”

**⁶** Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience,

**⁷** God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”[^4621]

**⁸** For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.

**⁹** There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

**¹⁰** For whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His.

**¹¹** Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.

## The Living Word

**(2 Timothy 3:10–17)**

**¹²** For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

**¹³** Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

**¹⁴** Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess.

**¹⁵** For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.

**¹⁶** Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
