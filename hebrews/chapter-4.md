# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it. 

<sup>2</sup> For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it. 

<sup>3</sup> Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said: “So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’” And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world. 

<sup>4</sup> For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.” 

<sup>5</sup> And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.” 

<sup>6</sup> Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience, 

<sup>7</sup> God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.” 

<sup>8</sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. 

<sup>9</sup> There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. 

<sup>10</sup> For whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His. 

<sup>11</sup> Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. 

<sup>12</sup> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 

<sup>13</sup> Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. 

<sup>14</sup> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess. 

<sup>15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. 

<sup>16</sup> Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
