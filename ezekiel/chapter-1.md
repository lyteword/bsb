# Chapter 1

## Ezekiel’s Vision by the River Kebar

**(Psalms 137:1–9)**

**¹** In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.[^2995]

**²** On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—

**³** the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans [^2996] by the River Kebar. And there the LORD’s hand was upon him.

## The Four Living Creatures

**⁴** I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire was a gleam like amber,[^2997]

**⁵** and within it was the form of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had a human form,

**⁶** but each had four faces and four wings.

**⁷** Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze.

**⁸** Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four living creatures had faces and wings,

**⁹** and their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.

**¹⁰** The form of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle.

**¹¹** Such were their faces. Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.

**¹²** Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.

**¹³** In the midst of the living creatures was the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.

**¹⁴** The creatures were darting back and forth as quickly as flashes of lightning.

## The Four Wheels

**¹⁵** When I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.

**¹⁶** The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. Their workmanship looked like a wheel within a wheel.

**¹⁷** As they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved.

**¹⁸** Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.

**¹⁹** So as the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.

**²⁰** Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

**²¹** When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

## The Divine Glory

**²²** Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an awesome expanse, gleaming like crystal.

**²³** And under the expanse, their wings stretched out toward one another. Each one also had two wings covering its body.

**²⁴** When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty,[^2998] like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.

**²⁵** And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.

**²⁶** Above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire, and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man.

**²⁷** From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire within it all around. And from what seemed to be His waist down, I saw what looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him.

**²⁸** The appearance of the brilliant light all around Him was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking.

[^2995]: 1:1 Or from God
[^2996]: 1:3 That is, the Babylonians
[^2997]: 1:4 Or The center of the fire looked like glowing metal; similarly in verse 27
[^2998]: 1:24 Hebrew Shaddai
