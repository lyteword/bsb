# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 

<sup>2</sup> A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left. 

<sup>3</sup> Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool. 

<sup>4</sup> If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest. 

<sup>5</sup> There is an evil I have seen under the sun— an error that proceeds from the ruler: 

<sup>6</sup> Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions. 

<sup>7</sup> I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. 

<sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake. 

<sup>9</sup> The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself. 

<sup>10</sup> If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success. 

<sup>11</sup> If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer. 

<sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him. 

<sup>13</sup> The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness. 

<sup>14</sup> Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him? 

<sup>15</sup> The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city. 

<sup>16</sup> Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning. 

<sup>17</sup> Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time— for strength and not for drunkenness. 

<sup>18</sup> Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks. 

<sup>19</sup> A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything. 

<sup>20</sup> Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.
