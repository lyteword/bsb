# Chapter 10

## Wisdom and Folly

**¹** As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.

**²** A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.

**³** Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.

**⁴** If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.

**⁵** There is an evil I have seen under the sun— an error that proceeds from the ruler:

**⁶** Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions.

**⁷** I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.

**⁸** He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.

**⁹** The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself.

**¹⁰** If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success.

**¹¹** If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.

**¹²** The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.

**¹³** The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness.

**¹⁴** Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him?

**¹⁵** The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.

**¹⁶** Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth,[^2536] and whose princes feast in the morning.

**¹⁷** Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time— for strength and not for drunkenness.

**¹⁸** Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.

**¹⁹** A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.

**²⁰** Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.
