# Chapter 1

## Everything Is Futile

<sup>1</sup> These are the words of the Teacher,[^2525] the son of David, king in Jerusalem:

<sup>2</sup> “Futility [^2526] of futilities,” says the Teacher, “futility of futilities! Everything is futile!”

<sup>3</sup> What does a man gain from all his labor, at which he toils under the sun?

<sup>4</sup> Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.

<sup>5</sup> The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries back to where it rises.

<sup>6</sup> The wind blows southward, then turns northward; round and round it swirls, ever returning on its course.

<sup>7</sup> All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place from which the streams come, there again they flow.

<sup>8</sup> All things are wearisome, more than one can describe; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear content with hearing.

<sup>9</sup> What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

<sup>10</sup> Is there a case where one can say, “Look, this is new”? It has already existed in the ages before us.

<sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of those who came before, and those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow after.

## With Wisdom Comes Sorrow

<sup>12</sup> I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a miserable task God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!

<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.

<sup>15</sup> What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.

<sup>16</sup> I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”

<sup>17</sup> So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.

<sup>18</sup> For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, and as knowledge grows, grief increases.

[^2525]: 1:1 Or the Convener or the Preacher or the leader of the assembly; Hebrew Qoheleth is rendered as the Teacher throughout Ecclesiastes.
[^2526]: 1:2 Literally vapor or breath; the Hebrew words translated in Ecclesiastes as forms of futile or fleeting can also be translated as vanity or meaningless.
