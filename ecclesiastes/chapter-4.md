# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Again I looked, and I considered all the oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter. 

<sup>2</sup> So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive. 

<sup>3</sup> But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. 

<sup>4</sup> I saw that all labor and success spring from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind. 

<sup>5</sup> The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh. 

<sup>6</sup> Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind. 

<sup>7</sup> Again, I saw futility under the sun. 

<sup>8</sup> There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?” This too is futile—a miserable task. 

<sup>9</sup> Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor. 

<sup>10</sup> For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up! 

<sup>11</sup> Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone? 

<sup>12</sup> And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken. 

<sup>13</sup> Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning. 

<sup>14</sup> For the youth has come from the prison to the kingship, though he was born poor in his own kingdom. 

<sup>15</sup> I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed this second one, the youth who succeeded the king. 

<sup>16</sup> There is no limit to all the people who were before them. Yet the successor will not be celebrated by those who come even later. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
