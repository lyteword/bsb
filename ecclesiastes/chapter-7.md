# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> A good name is better than fine perfume, and one’s day of death is better than his day of birth. 

<sup>2</sup> It is better to enter a house of mourning than a house of feasting, since death is the end of every man, and the living should take this to heart. 

<sup>3</sup> Sorrow is better than laughter, for a sad countenance is good for the heart. 

<sup>4</sup> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. 

<sup>5</sup> It is better to heed a wise man’s rebuke than to listen to the song of fools. 

<sup>6</sup> For like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile. 

<sup>7</sup> Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. 

<sup>8</sup> The end of a matter is better than the beginning, and a patient spirit is better than a proud one. 

<sup>9</sup> Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger settles in the lap of a fool. 

<sup>10</sup> Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is unwise of you to ask about this. 

<sup>11</sup> Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good, and it benefits those who see the sun. 

<sup>12</sup> For wisdom, like money, is a shelter, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner. 

<sup>13</sup> Consider the work of God: Who can straighten what He has bent? 

<sup>14</sup> In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider this: God has made one of these along with the other, so that a man cannot discover anything that will come after him. 

<sup>15</sup> In my futile life I have seen both of these: A righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness. 

<sup>16</sup> Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself? 

<sup>17</sup> Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? 

<sup>18</sup> It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings. 

<sup>19</sup> Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers in a city. 

<sup>20</sup> Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you. 

<sup>22</sup> For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others. 

<sup>23</sup> All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me. 

<sup>24</sup> What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it? 

<sup>25</sup> I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness. 

<sup>26</sup> And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared. 

<sup>27</sup> “Behold,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation. 

<sup>28</sup> While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found one such woman. 

<sup>29</sup> Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made men upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”
