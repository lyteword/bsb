# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, 

<sup>2</sup> and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed. 

<sup>3</sup> Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially. 

<sup>4</sup> And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining. 

<sup>5</sup> So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.” 

<sup>6</sup> Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. 

<sup>7</sup> They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’ 

<sup>8</sup> You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.” 

<sup>9</sup> He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition. 

<sup>10</sup> For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ 

<sup>11</sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God), 

<sup>12</sup> he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother. 

<sup>13</sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.” 

<sup>14</sup> Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “All of you, listen to Me and understand: 

<sup>15</sup> Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.”
