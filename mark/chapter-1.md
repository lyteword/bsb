# Chapter 1

## The Mission of John the Baptist

**(Isaiah 40:1–5; Matthew 3:1–17; Luke 3:1–22; John 1:19–34)**

<sup>1</sup> This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.[^3736]

<sup>2</sup> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:[^3737] “Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way.”[^3738]

<sup>3</sup> “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.’”[^3739]

<sup>4</sup> John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

<sup>5</sup> People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

<sup>6</sup> John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.

<sup>7</sup> And he proclaimed: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.

<sup>8</sup> I baptize you with water,[^3740] but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.[^3741]”

<sup>9</sup> In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

<sup>10</sup> As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw [^3742] the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.

<sup>11</sup> And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”

## The Temptation and Preaching of Jesus

**(Matthew 4:1–17; Luke 4:1–15)**

<sup>12</sup> At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,

<sup>13</sup> and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.

<sup>14</sup> After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.[^3743]

<sup>15</sup> “The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”

## The First Disciples

**(Matthew 4:18–22; Luke 5:1–11; John 1:35–42)**

<sup>16</sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

<sup>17</sup> “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”

<sup>18</sup> And at once they left their nets and followed Him.

<sup>19</sup> Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.

<sup>20</sup> Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.

## Jesus Expels an Unclean Spirit

**(Luke 4:31–37)**

<sup>21</sup> Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.

<sup>22</sup> The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.

<sup>23</sup> Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:

<sup>24</sup> “What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”

<sup>25</sup> But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!”

<sup>26</sup> At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.

<sup>27</sup> All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”

<sup>28</sup> And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.

## Jesus Heals at Peter’s House

**(Matthew 8:14–17; Luke 4:38–41)**

<sup>29</sup> As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.

<sup>30</sup> Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her.

<sup>31</sup> So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.

<sup>32</sup> That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed,

<sup>33</sup> and the whole town gathered at the door.

<sup>34</sup> And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.

## Jesus Prays and Preaches

**(Luke 4:42–44)**

<sup>35</sup> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and went out to a solitary place to pray.

<sup>36</sup> Simon and his companions went to look for Him,

<sup>37</sup> and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!”

<sup>38</sup> But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.”

<sup>39</sup> So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

## The Leper’s Prayer

**(Leviticus 14:1–32; Matthew 8:1–4; Luke 5:12–16)**

<sup>40</sup> Then a leper [^3744] came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”

<sup>41</sup> Moved with compassion,[^3745] Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!”

<sup>42</sup> And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed.

<sup>43</sup> Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning:

<sup>44</sup> “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”[^3746]

<sup>45</sup> But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.
