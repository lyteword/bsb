# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

<sup>2</sup> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way.” 

<sup>3</sup> “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.’” 

<sup>4</sup> John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 

<sup>5</sup> People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 

<sup>6</sup> John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 

<sup>7</sup> And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 

<sup>8</sup> I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” 

<sup>9</sup> In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 

<sup>10</sup> As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove. 

<sup>11</sup> And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.” 

<sup>12</sup> At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness, 

<sup>13</sup> and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him. 

<sup>14</sup> After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. 

<sup>15</sup> “The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!” 

<sup>16</sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 

<sup>17</sup> “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 

<sup>18</sup> And at once they left their nets and followed Him. 

<sup>19</sup> Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets. 

<sup>20</sup> Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him. 

<sup>21</sup> Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. 

<sup>22</sup> The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 

<sup>23</sup> Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue: 

<sup>24</sup> “What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” 

<sup>25</sup> But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” 

<sup>26</sup> At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek. 

<sup>27</sup> All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” 

<sup>28</sup> And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee. 

<sup>29</sup> As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 

<sup>30</sup> Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her. 

<sup>31</sup> So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them. 

<sup>32</sup> That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed, 

<sup>33</sup> and the whole town gathered at the door. 

<sup>34</sup> And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was. 

<sup>35</sup> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray. 

<sup>36</sup> Simon and his companions went to look for Him, 

<sup>37</sup> and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!” 

<sup>38</sup> But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.” 

<sup>39</sup> So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. 

<sup>40</sup> Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” 

<sup>41</sup> Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” 

<sup>42</sup> And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed. 

<sup>43</sup> Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning: 

<sup>44</sup> “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” 

<sup>45</sup> But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.
