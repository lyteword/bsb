# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin devised a plan. They bound Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. 

<sup>3</sup> And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things. 

<sup>4</sup> Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!” 

<sup>5</sup> But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply. 

<sup>6</sup> Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast to release to the people a prisoner of their choosing. 

<sup>7</sup> And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection. 

<sup>8</sup> So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom. 

<sup>9</sup> “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked. 

<sup>10</sup> For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over. 

<sup>11</sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead. 

<sup>12</sup> So Pilate asked them again, “What then do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?” 

<sup>13</sup> And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!” 

<sup>14</sup> “Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!” 

<sup>15</sup> And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified. 

<sup>16</sup> Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company together. 

<sup>17</sup> They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and set it on His head. 

<sup>18</sup> And they began to salute Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!” 

<sup>19</sup> They kept striking His head with a staff and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him. 

<sup>20</sup> After they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him. 

<sup>21</sup> Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus. 

<sup>22</sup> They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull. 

<sup>23</sup> There they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it. 

<sup>24</sup> And they crucified Him. They also divided His garments by casting lots to decide what each of them would take. 

<sup>25</sup> It was the third hour when they crucified Him. 

<sup>26</sup> And the charge inscribed against Him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>27</sup> Along with Jesus, they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.
