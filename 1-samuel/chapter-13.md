# Chapter 13

## War with the Philistines

<sup>1</sup> Saul was thirty years old[^1010] when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.[^1011]

<sup>2</sup> He chose for himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home.

<sup>3</sup> Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”

<sup>4</sup> And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.

<sup>5</sup> Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand [^1012] chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.

<sup>6</sup> Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns.

<sup>7</sup> Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear.

## Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice

<sup>8</sup> And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul.

<sup>9</sup> So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering.

<sup>10</sup> Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.

<sup>11</sup> “What have you done?” Samuel asked. And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,

<sup>12</sup> I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”

<sup>13</sup> “You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command that the LORD your God gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.

<sup>14</sup> But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.”

<sup>15</sup> Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin.[^1013] And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.

## Israel without Weapons

<sup>16</sup> Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.

<sup>17</sup> And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,

<sup>18</sup> another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.

<sup>19</sup> And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.”

<sup>20</sup> Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.[^1014]

<sup>21</sup> The charge was a pim [^1015] for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad.[^1016]

<sup>22</sup> So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.

<sup>23</sup> And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash.

[^1010]: 13:1 A few late LXX manuscripts; MT Saul was a son of a year
[^1011]: 13:1 Or over Israel forty years (see Acts 13:21); MT over Israel two years
[^1012]: 13:5 Some LXX manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew thirty thousand
[^1013]: 13:15 LXX Then Samuel set out, and the rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.
[^1014]: 13:20 LXX; Hebrew and plowshares; (so plowshare appears twice in the Hebrew).
[^1015]: 13:21 A pim possibly refers to a polished stone weighing approximately 0.25 ounces or 7 grams found in excavations. This is equivalent to about two-thirds of a shekel and likely refers to the price charged by the Philistines for the services listed.
[^1016]: 13:21 Hebrew does not include the currency unit of a shekel charged for sharpening a pitchfork, an axe, or an oxgoad; alternatively, possibly a third of a pim for each.
