# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.” 

<sup>2</sup> So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 

<sup>3</sup> Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. 

<sup>4</sup> So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’” Then David crept up secretly and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. 

<sup>5</sup> Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe. 

<sup>6</sup> So he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.” 

<sup>7</sup> With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. 

<sup>8</sup> After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence 

<sup>9</sup> and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’? 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD’s anointed.’ 

<sup>11</sup> See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life. 

<sup>12</sup> May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you. 

<sup>13</sup> As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you. 

<sup>14</sup> Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 

<sup>15</sup> May the LORD be our judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.” 

<sup>16</sup> When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” Then Saul wept aloud 

<sup>17</sup> and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil. 

<sup>18</sup> And you have shown this day how well you have dealt with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. 

<sup>19</sup> When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day. 

<sup>20</sup> Now I know for sure that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 

<sup>21</sup> So now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.” 

<sup>22</sup> So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
