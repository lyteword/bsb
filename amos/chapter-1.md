## Judgment on Israel’s Neighbors

**(Jeremiah 12:14–17)**

<sup>1</sup> These are the words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders [^3355] of Tekoa—what he saw concerning Israel two years [^3356] before the earthquake, in the days when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash [^3357] was king of Israel.

<sup>2</sup> He said: “The LORD roars from Zion and raises His voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the summit of Carmel withers.”

<sup>3</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Damascus, even four, I will not revoke My judgment,[^3358] because they threshed Gilead with sledges of iron.

<sup>4</sup> So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael to consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.

<sup>5</sup> I will break down the gates of Damascus; I will cut off the ruler [^3359] from the Valley of Aven [^3360] and the one who wields the scepter in Beth-eden. The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,” says the LORD.

<sup>6</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Gaza, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they exiled a whole population, delivering them up to Edom.

<sup>7</sup> So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza, to consume its citadels.

<sup>8</sup> I will cut off the ruler of Ashdod and the one who wields the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn My hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,” says the Lord GOD.

<sup>9</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Tyre, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edom and broke a covenant of brotherhood.

<sup>10</sup> So I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre to consume its citadels.”

<sup>11</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Edom, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he pursued his brother with the sword and stifled all compassion; his anger raged continually, and his fury flamed incessantly.

<sup>12</sup> So I will send fire upon Teman to consume the citadels of Bozrah.”

<sup>13</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory.

<sup>14</sup> So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah to consume its citadels amid war cries on the day of battle and a violent wind on the day of tempest.

<sup>15</sup> Their king will go into exile [^3361]— he and his princes together,” says the LORD.
