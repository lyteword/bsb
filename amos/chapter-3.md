# Chapter 3

## Witnesses against Israel

<sup>1</sup> Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:

<sup>2</sup> “Only you have I known [^3365] from all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”

<sup>3</sup> Can two walk together without agreeing where to go?[^3366]

<sup>4</sup> Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?

<sup>5</sup> Does a bird land in a snare where no bait has been set? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has nothing to catch?

<sup>6</sup> If a ram’s horn sounds in a city, do the people not tremble? If calamity comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?

<sup>7</sup> Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.

<sup>8</sup> The lion has roared— who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken— who will not prophesy?

<sup>9</sup> Proclaim to the citadels of Ashdod and to the citadels of Egypt: “Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest in the city and the acts of oppression in her midst.”

<sup>10</sup> “For they know not how to do right,” declares the LORD. “They store up violence and destruction in their citadels.”

<sup>11</sup> Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “An enemy [^3367] will surround the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your citadels.”

<sup>12</sup> This is what the LORD says: “As the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear, so the Israelites dwelling in Samaria will be rescued having just the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch.[^3368]

<sup>13</sup> Hear and testify against the house of Jacob, declares the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts.

<sup>14</sup> On the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off, and they will fall to the ground.

<sup>15</sup> I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses of ivory will also perish, and the great houses will come to an end,” declares the LORD.

[^3365]: 3:2 Or chosen
[^3366]: 3:3 Or without an appointment to meet
[^3367]: 3:11 Or An adversary
[^3368]: 3:12 Or so will the Israelites be snatched away, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches
