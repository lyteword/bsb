# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he burned to lime the bones of Edom’s king. 

<sup>2</sup> So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn. 

<sup>3</sup> I will cut off the ruler of Moab and kill all the officials with him,” 

<sup>4</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they reject the Law of the LORD and fail to keep His statutes; they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked. 

<sup>5</sup> So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.” 

<sup>6</sup> This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals. 

<sup>7</sup> They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name. 

<sup>8</sup> They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God, they drink wine obtained through fines. 

<sup>9</sup> Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, though his height was like that of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below. 

<sup>10</sup> And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite. 

<sup>11</sup> I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?” 

<sup>12</sup> “But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy. 

<sup>13</sup> Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as with a cart full of grain. 

<sup>14</sup> Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life. 

<sup>15</sup> The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life. 

<sup>16</sup> Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,”
