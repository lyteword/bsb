# Chapter 2

## Judgment on Moab, Judah, and Israel

**¹** This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment,[^3362] because he burned to lime the bones of Edom’s king.

**²** So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn.

**³** I will cut off the ruler of Moab and kill all the officials with him,” says the LORD.

**⁴** This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they reject the Law of the LORD and fail to keep His statutes; they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked.

**⁵** So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”

**⁶** This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.

**⁷** They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name.

**⁸** They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God,[^3363] they drink wine obtained through fines.[^3364]

**⁹** Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, though his height was like that of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.

**¹⁰** And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.

**¹¹** I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?” declares the LORD.

**¹²** “But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.

**¹³** Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as with a cart full of grain.

**¹⁴** Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life.

**¹⁵** The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.

**¹⁶** Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,” declares the LORD.

[^3362]: 2:1 Or I will not revoke the punishment; Hebrew I will not revoke it; also in verses 4 and 6
[^3363]: 2:8 Or of their gods
[^3364]: 2:8 Or they drink the wine of those who have been fined
