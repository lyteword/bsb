# Chapter 3

## The Coming Judgment

**(Genesis 7:1–24; Jude 1:17–23)**

<sup>1</sup> Beloved, this is now my second letter to you. Both of them are reminders to stir you to wholesome thinking

<sup>2</sup> by recalling what was foretold by the holy prophets and commanded by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.

<sup>3</sup> Most importantly, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.[^4747]

<sup>4</sup> “Where is the promise of His coming?” they will ask. “Ever since our fathers fell asleep, everything continues as it has from the beginning of creation.”

<sup>5</sup> But they deliberately overlook the fact that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water,

<sup>6</sup> through which [^4748] the world of that time perished in the flood.

<sup>7</sup> And by that same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.

## The Day of the Lord

**(Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11)**

<sup>8</sup> Beloved, do not let this one thing escape your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.[^4749]

<sup>9</sup> The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.

<sup>10</sup> But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed [^4750] by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare.[^4751]

<sup>11</sup> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to conduct yourselves in holiness and godliness

<sup>12</sup> as you anticipate and hasten the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt in the heat.

<sup>13</sup> But in keeping with God’s promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.

## Final Exhortations

<sup>14</sup> Therefore, beloved, as you anticipate these things, make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and blameless in His sight.[^4752]

<sup>15</sup> Consider also that our Lord’s patience brings salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom God gave him.

<sup>16</sup> He writes this way in all his letters,[^4753] speaking in them about such matters. Some parts of his letters are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort,[^4754] as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.

<sup>17</sup> Therefore, beloved, since you already know these things, be on your guard so that you will not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure standing.

<sup>18</sup> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.[^4755]
