# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda. 

<sup>3</sup> On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.
