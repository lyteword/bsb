# Chapter 15

## Jesus the True Vine

**(Isaiah 27:1–13)**

**¹** “I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard.

**²** He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.

**³** You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

**⁴** Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.

**⁵** I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.

**⁶** If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.

**⁷** If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

**⁸** This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.

## No Greater Love

**⁹** As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.

**¹⁰** If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love.

**¹¹** I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.

**¹²** This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.

**¹³** Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.

**¹⁴** You are My friends if you do what I command you.

**¹⁵** No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.

**¹⁶** You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.

**¹⁷** This is My command to you: Love one another.

## The Hatred of the World

**¹⁸** If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first.

**¹⁹** If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.

**²⁰** Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’[^4097] If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.

**²¹** But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me.

**²²** If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.

**²³** Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well.

**²⁴** If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.

**²⁵** But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’[^4098]

**²⁶** When the Advocate [^4099] comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me.

**²⁷** And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
