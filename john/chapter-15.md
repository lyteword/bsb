# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> “I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard. 

<sup>2</sup> He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful. 

<sup>3</sup> You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. 

<sup>4</sup> Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. 

<sup>5</sup> I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing. 

<sup>6</sup> If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned. 

<sup>7</sup> If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 

<sup>8</sup> This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples. 

<sup>9</sup> As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love. 

<sup>10</sup> If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love. 

<sup>11</sup> I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. 

<sup>12</sup> This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 

<sup>13</sup> Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 

<sup>14</sup> You are My friends if you do what I command you. 

<sup>15</sup> No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you. 

<sup>16</sup> You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you. 

<sup>17</sup> This is My command to you: Love one another. 

<sup>18</sup> If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first. 

<sup>19</sup> If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. 

<sup>20</sup> Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well. 

<sup>21</sup> But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me. 

<sup>22</sup> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well. 

<sup>24</sup> If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father. 

<sup>25</sup> But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’ 

<sup>26</sup> When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me. 

<sup>27</sup> And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
