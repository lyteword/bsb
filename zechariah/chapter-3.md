# Chapter 3

## The Vision of Joshua the High Priest

<sup>1</sup> Then the angel showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel [^3480] of the LORD, with Satan [^3481] standing at his right hand to accuse him.

<sup>2</sup> And the LORD said to Satan: “The LORD rebukes you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you! Is not this man a firebrand [^3482] snatched from the fire?”

<sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the angel.

<sup>4</sup> So the angel said to those standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes!” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”

<sup>5</sup> Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him, as the angel of the LORD stood by.

<sup>6</sup> Then the angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:

<sup>7</sup> “This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, then you will govern My house and will also have charge of My courts; and I will give you a place among these who are standing here.

<sup>8</sup> Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.

<sup>9</sup> See the stone I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes.[^3483] Behold, I will engrave on it an inscription, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.

<sup>10</sup> On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, you will each invite your neighbor to sit under your own vine and fig tree.’”
