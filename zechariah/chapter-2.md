# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 

<sup>2</sup> “Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.” 

<sup>3</sup> Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him 

<sup>4</sup> and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it. 

<sup>5</sup> For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’” 

<sup>6</sup> “Get up! Get up! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> “Get up, O Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon!” 

<sup>8</sup> For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “After His Glory has sent Me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye— 

<sup>9</sup> I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.” 

<sup>10</sup> “Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD. 

<sup>11</sup> “On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD, and they will become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you. 

<sup>12</sup> And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> Be silent before the LORD, all people, for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”
