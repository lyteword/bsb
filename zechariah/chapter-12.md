# Chapter 12

## The Coming Deliverance of Jerusalem

**¹** This is the burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD, who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth, who forms the spirit of man within him:

**²** “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples. Judah will be besieged, as well as Jerusalem.

**³** On that day, when all the nations of the earth gather against her, I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who would heave it away will be severely injured.

**⁴** On that day, declares the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and every rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah, but I will strike with blindness all the horses of the nations.

**⁵** Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts: ‘The people of Jerusalem are my strength, for the LORD of Hosts is their God.’

**⁶** On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among the sheaves; they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and on the left, while the people of Jerusalem remain secure there.

**⁷** The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and of the people of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.

**⁸** On that day the LORD will defend the people of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel [^3516] of the LORD going before them.

**⁹** So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

## Mourning the One They Pierced

**(John 19:31–37)**

**¹⁰** Then I will pour out on the house of David and on the people of Jerusalem a spirit [^3517] of grace and prayer, and they will look on Me,[^3518] the One they have pierced.[^3519] They will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for Him as one grieves for a firstborn son.

**¹¹** On that day the wailing in Jerusalem will be as great as the wailing of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

**¹²** The land will mourn, each clan on its own: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,

**¹³** the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,

**¹⁴** and all the remaining clans and their wives.
