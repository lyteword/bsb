## The Restoration of Jerusalem

**(Micah 4:6–13)**

<sup>1</sup> Again the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying:

<sup>2</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I am jealous for Zion with great zeal; I am jealous for her with great fervor.”

<sup>3</sup> This is what the LORD says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of Hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.”

<sup>4</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Old men and old women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of great age.

<sup>5</sup> And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”

<sup>6</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “If this is impossible [^3504] in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be impossible in My eyes?” declares the LORD of Hosts.

<sup>7</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I will save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.

<sup>8</sup> I will bring them back to dwell in Jerusalem, where they will be My people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God.”

<sup>9</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were present when the foundations were laid to rebuild the temple, the house of the LORD of Hosts.

<sup>10</sup> For before those days neither man nor beast received wages, nor was there safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I had turned every man against his neighbor.

<sup>11</sup> But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the LORD of Hosts.

<sup>12</sup> “For the seed will be prosperous, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will yield its produce, and the skies will give their dew. To the remnant of this people I will give all these things as an inheritance.

<sup>13</sup> As you have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid; let your hands be strong.”

<sup>14</sup> For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Just as I resolved to bring disaster upon you when your fathers provoked Me to anger, and I did not relent,” says the LORD of Hosts,

<sup>15</sup> “so now I have resolved to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.

<sup>16</sup> These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another, render true and sound judgments in your gates,

<sup>17</sup> do not plot evil in your hearts against your neighbor, and do not love to swear falsely, for I hate all these things,” declares the LORD.

<sup>18</sup> Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying,

<sup>19</sup> “This is what the LORD of Hosts says: The fasts of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months will become times of joy and gladness, cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore you are to love both truth and peace.”

<sup>20</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Peoples will yet come—the residents of many cities—

<sup>21</sup> and the residents of one city will go to another, saying: ‘Let us go at once to plead before the LORD and to seek the LORD of Hosts. I myself am going.’

<sup>22</sup> And many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem and to plead before the LORD.”

<sup>23</sup> This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue will tightly grasp the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’”
