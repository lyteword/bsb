# Chapter 4

## The Vision of the Lampstand and Olive Trees

**¹** Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and woke me, as a man is awakened from his sleep.

**²** “What do you see?” he asked. “I see a solid gold lampstand,” I replied, “with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven spouts to the lamps.

**³** There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left.”

**⁴** “What are these, my lord?” I asked the angel who was speaking with me.

**⁵** “Do you not know what they are?” replied the angel. “No, my lord,” I answered.

**⁶** So he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts.

**⁷** What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. Then he will bring forth the capstone accompanied by shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”

**⁸** Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

**⁹** “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.

**¹⁰** For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven eyes [^3484] of the LORD, which scan the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line [^3485] in the hand of Zerubbabel.”

**¹¹** Then I asked the angel, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”

**¹²** And I questioned him further, “What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the golden oil [^3486] pours?”

**¹³** “Do you not know what these are?” he inquired. “No, my lord,” I replied.

**¹⁴** So he said, “These are the two anointed ones [^3487] who are standing beside the Lord of all the earth.”[^3488]
