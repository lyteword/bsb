# Chapter 4

## Solomon Admires His Bride

## The Bridegroom

<sup>1</sup> How beautiful you are, my darling— how very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.

<sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.

<sup>3</sup> Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon, and your mouth is lovely. Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.

<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like the tower of David, built with rows of stones; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.

<sup>5</sup> Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle grazing among the lilies.

<sup>6</sup> Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.

<sup>7</sup> You are altogether beautiful, my darling; in you there is no flaw.

<sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon! Descend [^2547] from the peak of Amana, from the summits of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.

<sup>9</sup> You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your neck.

<sup>10</sup> How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! Your love is much better than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than all spices.

<sup>11</sup> Your lips, my bride, drip sweetness like the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue, and the fragrance of your garments is like the aroma of Lebanon.

<sup>12</sup> My sister, my bride, you are a garden locked up, a spring enclosed, a fountain sealed.

<sup>13</sup> Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates with the choicest of fruits, with henna and nard,

<sup>14</sup> with nard and saffron, with calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of frankincense tree, with myrrh and aloes, with all the finest spices.

<sup>15</sup> You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water [^2548] flowing down from Lebanon.

## The Bride

<sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind. Breathe on my garden and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choicest fruits.

[^2547]: 4:8 Or Look down
[^2548]: 4:15 Or flowing water or living water
