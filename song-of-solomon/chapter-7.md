# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master. 

<sup>2</sup> Your navel is a rounded goblet; it never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by the lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 

<sup>4</sup> Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus. 

<sup>5</sup> Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple threads; the king is captured in your tresses. 

<sup>6</sup> How fair and pleasant you are, O love, with your delights! 

<sup>7</sup> Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit. 

<sup>8</sup> I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples, 

<sup>9</sup> and your mouth like the finest wine. May it flow smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth. 

<sup>10</sup> I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside; let us spend the night among the wildflowers. 

<sup>12</sup> Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom— there I will give you my love. 

<sup>13</sup> The mandrakes send forth a fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old, that I have treasured up for you, my beloved.
