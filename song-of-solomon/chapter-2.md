## The Bride’s Admiration

## The Bride

<sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon,[^2542] a lily of the valley.

## The Bridegroom

<sup>2</sup> Like a lily among the thorns is my darling among the maidens.

## The Bride

<sup>3</sup> Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.

<sup>4</sup> He has brought me to the house of wine,[^2543] and his banner over me is love.

<sup>5</sup> Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.

<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.

<sup>7</sup> O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.

<sup>8</sup> Listen! My beloved approaches. Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.

<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.

<sup>10</sup> My beloved calls to me, “Arise, my darling. Come away with me, my beautiful one.

<sup>11</sup> For now the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.

<sup>12</sup> The flowers have appeared in the countryside; the season of singing [^2544] has come, and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.

<sup>13</sup> The fig tree ripens its figs; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come away, my darling; come away with me, my beautiful one.”

## The Bridegroom

<sup>14</sup> O my dove in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your countenance is lovely.

## The Friends

<sup>15</sup> Catch for us the foxes— the little foxes that ruin the vineyards— for our vineyards are in bloom.

## The Bride

<sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine and I am his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.

<sup>17</sup> Before the day breaks and shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.[^2545]
