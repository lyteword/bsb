# Chapter 5

## The Bride and Her Beloved

## The Bridegroom

<sup>1</sup> I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.

## The Friends Eat, O friends, and drink; drink freely, O beloved.

## The Bride

<sup>2</sup> I sleep, but my heart is awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”

<sup>3</sup> I have taken off my robe— must I put it back on? I have washed my feet— must I soil them again?

<sup>4</sup> My beloved put his hand to the latch; my heart pounded for him.

<sup>5</sup> I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.

<sup>6</sup> I opened for my beloved, but he had turned and gone. My heart sank at his departure. I sought him but did not find him. I called, but he did not answer.

<sup>7</sup> I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city. They beat me and bruised me; they took away my cloak, those guardians of the walls.

<sup>8</sup> O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you, if you find my beloved, tell him I am sick with love.

## The Friends

<sup>9</sup> How is your beloved better than others, O most beautiful among women? How is your beloved better than another, that you charge us so?

## The Bride

<sup>10</sup> My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.

<sup>11</sup> His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.

<sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside the streams of water, bathed in milk and mounted like jewels.

<sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like beds of spice, towers of perfume. His lips are like lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.

<sup>14</sup> His arms are rods of gold set with beryl. His body is polished ivory bedecked with sapphires.

<sup>15</sup> His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars.

<sup>16</sup> His mouth [^2549] is most sweet; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
