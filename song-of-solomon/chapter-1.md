# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> This is Solomon’s Song of Songs. 

<sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is more delightful than wine. 

<sup>3</sup> The fragrance of your perfume is pleasing; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens adore you. 

<sup>4</sup> Take me away with you—let us hurry! May the king bring me to his chambers. We will rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. It is only right that they adore you. 

<sup>5</sup> I am dark, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 

<sup>6</sup> Do not stare because I am dark, for the sun has gazed upon me. My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me a keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have neglected. 

<sup>7</sup> Tell me, O one I love, where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you rest them at midday? Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions? 

<sup>8</sup> If you do not know, O fairest of women, follow the tracks of the flock, and graze your young goats near the tents of the shepherds. 

<sup>9</sup> I compare you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots. 

<sup>10</sup> Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 

<sup>11</sup> We will make you ornaments of gold, studded with beads of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance. 

<sup>13</sup> My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts. 

<sup>14</sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi. 

<sup>15</sup> How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves. 

<sup>16</sup> How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how delightful! The soft grass is our bed. 

<sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are fragrant firs.
