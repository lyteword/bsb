# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you. 

<sup>2</sup> My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies. 

<sup>4</sup> You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners. 

<sup>5</sup> Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead. 

<sup>6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost. 

<sup>7</sup> Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate. 

<sup>8</sup> There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number, 

<sup>9</sup> but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises. 

<sup>10</sup> Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession? 

<sup>11</sup> I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding or the pomegranates were in bloom. 

<sup>12</sup> Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the royal chariots of my people. 

<sup>13</sup> Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim ?
