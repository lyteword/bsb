## David’s Triumphs

**(1 Chronicles 18:1–13; Psalms 60:1–12)**

<sup>1</sup> Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah [^1091] from the hand of the Philistines.

<sup>2</sup> David also defeated the Moabites, made them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a cord. He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.

<sup>3</sup> David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, who had marched out to restore his dominion along the Euphrates River.[^1092]

<sup>4</sup> David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers,[^1093] and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.

<sup>5</sup> When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of their men.

<sup>6</sup> Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.

<sup>7</sup> And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.

<sup>8</sup> And from Betah [^1094] and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze.

<sup>9</sup> When King Toi [^1095] of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,

<sup>10</sup> he sent his son Joram [^1096] to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze,

<sup>11</sup> and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued—

<sup>12</sup> from Edom [^1097] and Moab, from the Ammonites and Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

<sup>13</sup> And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites [^1098] in the Valley of Salt.

<sup>14</sup> He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
