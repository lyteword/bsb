# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And David sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. 

<sup>2</sup> He said: “The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. 

<sup>3</sup> My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation. My stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior, You save me from violence. 

<sup>4</sup> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies. 

<sup>5</sup> For the waves of death engulfed me; the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> The cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me. 

<sup>7</sup> In my distress I called upon the LORD; I cried out to my God. And from His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for help reached His ears. 

<sup>8</sup> Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the heavens trembled; they were shaken because He burned with anger. 

<sup>9</sup> Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; glowing coals blazed forth. 

<sup>10</sup> He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds beneath His feet. 

<sup>11</sup> He mounted a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind. 

<sup>12</sup> He made darkness a canopy around Him, a gathering of water and thick clouds. 

<sup>13</sup> From the brightness of His presence coals of fire blazed forth. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. 

<sup>15</sup> He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; He hurled lightning and routed them. 

<sup>16</sup> The channels of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils. 

<sup>17</sup> He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters. 

<sup>18</sup> He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from foes too mighty for me. 

<sup>19</sup> They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD was my support. 

<sup>20</sup> He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me. 

<sup>21</sup> The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands. 

<sup>22</sup> For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God. 

<sup>23</sup> For all His ordinances are before me; I have not disregarded His statutes. 

<sup>24</sup> And I have been blameless before Him and kept myself from iniquity. 

<sup>25</sup> So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight. 

<sup>26</sup> To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, to the blameless You show Yourself blameless; 

<sup>27</sup> to the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. 

<sup>28</sup> You save an afflicted people, but Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down. 

<sup>29</sup> For You, O LORD, are my lamp; the LORD lights up my darkness. 

<sup>30</sup> For in You I can charge an army; with my God I can scale a wall. 

<sup>31</sup> As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. 

<sup>32</sup> For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? 

<sup>33</sup> God is my strong fortress and He makes my way clear. 

<sup>34</sup> He makes my feet like those of a deer and stations me upon the heights. 

<sup>35</sup> He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 

<sup>36</sup> You have given me Your shield of salvation, and Your gentleness exalts me. 

<sup>37</sup> You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not give way. 

<sup>38</sup> I pursued my enemies and destroyed them; I did not turn back until they were consumed. 

<sup>39</sup> I devoured and crushed them so they could not rise; they have fallen under my feet. 

<sup>40</sup> You have armed me with strength for battle; You have subdued my foes beneath me. 

<sup>41</sup> You have made my enemies retreat before me; I put an end to those who hated me. 

<sup>42</sup> They looked, but there was no one to save them— to the LORD, but He did not answer. 

<sup>43</sup> I ground them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and trampled them like mud in the streets. 

<sup>44</sup> You have delivered me from the strife of my people; You have preserved me as the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me. 

<sup>45</sup> Foreigners cower before me; when they hear me, they obey me. 

<sup>46</sup> Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds. 

<sup>47</sup> The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! And may God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted— 

<sup>48</sup> the God who avenges me and brings down nations beneath me, 

<sup>49</sup> who frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent men. 

<sup>50</sup> Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name. 

<sup>51</sup> Great salvation He brings to His king. He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
