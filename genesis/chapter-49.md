# Chapter 49

## Jacob Blesses His Sons

**¹** Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the days to come:

**²** Come together and listen, O sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.

**³** Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.

**⁴** Uncontrolled as the waters, you will no longer excel, because you went up to your father’s bed, onto my couch, and defiled it.

**⁵** Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords [^217] are weapons of violence.

**⁶** May I never enter their council; may I never join their assembly. For they kill men in their anger, and hamstring oxen on a whim.

**⁷** Cursed be their anger, for it is strong, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will disperse them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

**⁸** Judah,[^218] your brothers shall praise you. Your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; your father’s sons shall bow down to you.

**⁹** Judah is a young lion— my son, you return from the prey. Like a lion he crouches and lies down; like a lioness, who dares to rouse him?

**¹⁰** The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the staff from between his feet,[^219] until Shiloh [^220] comes and the allegiance of the nations is his.

**¹¹** He ties his donkey to the vine, his colt to the choicest branch. He washes his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.

**¹²** His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.

**¹³** Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore and become a harbor for ships; his border shall extend to Sidon.

**¹⁴** Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.[^221]

**¹⁵** He saw that his resting place was good and that his land was pleasant, so he bent his shoulder to the burden and submitted to labor as a servant.

**¹⁶** Dan shall provide justice for his people [^222] as one of the tribes of Israel.

**¹⁷** He will be a snake by the road, a viper in the path that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward.

**¹⁸** I await Your salvation, O LORD.

**¹⁹** Gad [^223] will be attacked by raiders, but he will attack their heels.

**²⁰** Asher’s food will be rich; he shall provide royal delicacies.

**²¹** Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.[^224]

**²²** Joseph is a fruitful vine— a fruitful vine by a spring, whose branches scale the wall.[^225]

**²³** The archers attacked him with bitterness; they aimed at him in hostility.

**²⁴** Yet he steadied his bow, and his strong arms were tempered by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, in the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,

**²⁵** by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty [^226] who blesses you, with blessings of the heavens above, with blessings of the depths below, with blessings of the breasts and womb.

**²⁶** The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains [^227] and the bounty of the everlasting hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers.

**²⁷** Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.”

**²⁸** These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing.

## The Death of Jacob

**²⁹** Then Jacob instructed them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.

**³⁰** The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.

**³¹** There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried, and there I buried Leah.

**³²** The field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.”

**³³** When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he pulled his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and he was gathered to his people.

[^217]: 49:5 Or dwelling places
[^218]: 49:8 Judah sounds like the Hebrew for praise.
[^219]: 49:10 Or from his descendants
[^220]: 49:10 Or until the one to whom tribute belongs
[^221]: 49:14 Or saddlebags or hearths
[^222]: 49:16 Or Dan shall judge his people; Dan means He has judged or He has vindicated.
[^223]: 49:19 Gad sounds like the Hebrew for raid and also for band of raiders.
[^224]: 49:21 Or gives beautiful words or bears fawns of the fold
[^225]: 49:22 Or Joseph is a wild donkey, a wild donkey by a spring, with his wild colts beside the wall
[^226]: 49:25 Hebrew Shaddai
[^227]: 49:26 Or of my ancestors
