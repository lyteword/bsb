# Chapter 16

## Hagar and Ishmael

**¹** Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.

**²** So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

**³** So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.

**⁴** And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.[^74]

**⁵** Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”

**⁶** “Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.

**⁷** Now the angel [^75] of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.

**⁸** “Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.

**⁹** So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.”

**¹⁰** Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”

**¹¹** The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael,[^76] for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.

**¹²** He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”

**¹³** So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,[^77]” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!”

**¹⁴** Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi.[^78] It is located between Kadesh and Bered.

**¹⁵** And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.

**¹⁶** Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
