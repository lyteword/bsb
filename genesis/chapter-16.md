# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. 

<sup>2</sup> So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 

<sup>3</sup> So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife. 

<sup>4</sup> And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 

<sup>5</sup> Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.” 

<sup>6</sup> “Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her. 

<sup>7</sup> Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur. 

<sup>8</sup> “Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied. 

<sup>9</sup> So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.” 

<sup>10</sup> Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.” 

<sup>11</sup> The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction. 

<sup>12</sup> He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.” 

<sup>13</sup> So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!” 

<sup>14</sup> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered. 

<sup>15</sup> And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. 

<sup>16</sup> Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
