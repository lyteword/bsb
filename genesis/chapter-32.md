# Chapter 32

## Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau

**¹** Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

**²** When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim.[^148]

**³** Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

**⁴** He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now.

**⁵** I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’”

**⁶** When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.”

**⁷** In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels.

**⁸** He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.”

**⁹** Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’

**¹⁰** I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.

**¹¹** Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me.

**¹²** But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’”

**¹³** Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau:

**¹⁴** 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,

**¹⁵** 30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.

**¹⁶** He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.”

**¹⁷** He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’

**¹⁸** then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’”

**¹⁹** He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him.

**²⁰** You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau [^149] with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.[^150]”

**²¹** So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp.

## Jacob Wrestles with God

**²²** During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

**²³** He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.

**²⁴** So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man [^151] wrestled with him until daybreak.

**²⁵** When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled.

**²⁶** Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”

**²⁷** “What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied.

**²⁸** Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob,[^152] but Israel,[^153] because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”

**²⁹** And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.

**³⁰** So Jacob named the place Peniel,[^154] saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”

**³¹** The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel,[^155] and he was limping because of his hip.

**³²** Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon.
