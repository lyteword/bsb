# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 

<sup>2</sup> When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim. 

<sup>3</sup> Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 

<sup>4</sup> He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now. 

<sup>5</sup> I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’” 

<sup>6</sup> When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.” 

<sup>7</sup> In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels. 

<sup>8</sup> He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.” 

<sup>9</sup> Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’ 

<sup>10</sup> I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 

<sup>11</sup> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me. 

<sup>12</sup> But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’” 

<sup>13</sup> Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 

<sup>14</sup> 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 

<sup>15</sup> 30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys. 

<sup>16</sup> He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.” 

<sup>17</sup> He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’ 

<sup>18</sup> then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’” 

<sup>19</sup> He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him. 

<sup>20</sup> You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.” 

<sup>21</sup> So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp. 

<sup>22</sup> During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 

<sup>23</sup> He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions. 

<sup>24</sup> So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak. 

<sup>25</sup> When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. 

<sup>26</sup> Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” 

<sup>27</sup> “What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied. 

<sup>28</sup> Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.” 

<sup>29</sup> And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there. 

<sup>30</sup> So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” 

<sup>31</sup> The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 

<sup>32</sup> Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon which is at the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon.
