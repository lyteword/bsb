# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom). 

<sup>2</sup> Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 

<sup>3</sup> and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 

<sup>4</sup> And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath gave birth to Reuel, 

<sup>5</sup> and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 

<sup>6</sup> Later, Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the people of his household, along with his livestock, all his other animals, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan, and he moved to a land far away from his brother Jacob. 

<sup>7</sup> For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together; the land where they stayed could not support them because of their livestock. 

<sup>8</sup> So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the area of Mount Seir.
