# Chapter 15

## God’s Covenant with Abram

**(Romans 4:1–12; Hebrews 11:8–19)**

**¹** After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”

**²** But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”

**³** Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”

**⁴** Then the word of the LORD came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”

**⁵** And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.”[^71]

**⁶** Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.[^72]

**⁷** The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”

## God Confirms His Promise

**(Numbers 34:1–15; Romans 4:13–25)**

**⁸** But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”

**⁹** And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”

**¹⁰** So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half.

**¹¹** And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

**¹²** As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.

**¹³** Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.

**¹⁴** But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions.[^73]

**¹⁵** You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.

**¹⁶** In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”

**¹⁷** When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses.

**¹⁸** On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—

**¹⁹** the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,

**²⁰** Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,

**²¹** Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
