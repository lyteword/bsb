# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.” 

<sup>2</sup> But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 

<sup>3</sup> Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.” 

<sup>4</sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.” 

<sup>5</sup> And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.” 

<sup>6</sup> Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” 

<sup>8</sup> But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?” 

<sup>9</sup> And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.” 

<sup>10</sup> So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half. 

<sup>11</sup> And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 

<sup>12</sup> As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him. 

<sup>13</sup> Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. 

<sup>14</sup> But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions. 

<sup>15</sup> You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age. 

<sup>16</sup> In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 

<sup>17</sup> When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses. 

<sup>18</sup> On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates— 

<sup>19</sup> the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 

<sup>20</sup> Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 

<sup>21</sup> Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
