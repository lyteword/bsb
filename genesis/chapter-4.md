# Chapter 4

## Cain and Abel

**(Hebrews 11:4)**

<sup>1</sup> And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain.[^18] “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said.

<sup>2</sup> Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.

<sup>3</sup> So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,

<sup>4</sup> while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,

<sup>5</sup> but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.

<sup>6</sup> “Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen?

<sup>7</sup> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you,[^19] but you must master it.”

<sup>8</sup> Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” [^20] And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.

<sup>9</sup> And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

<sup>10</sup> “What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.

<sup>11</sup> Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

<sup>12</sup> When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

<sup>13</sup> But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment [^21] is greater than I can bear.

<sup>14</sup> Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”

<sup>15</sup> “Not so!”[^22] replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.

<sup>16</sup> So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod,[^23] east of Eden.

## The Descendants of Cain

<sup>17</sup> And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.

<sup>18</sup> Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech.

<sup>19</sup> And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.

<sup>20</sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock.

<sup>21</sup> And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.

<sup>22</sup> And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

<sup>23</sup> Then Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.

<sup>24</sup> If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”[^24]

## Seth and Enosh

<sup>25</sup> And Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,[^25] saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”

<sup>26</sup> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called him Enosh. At that time men began to call upon [^26] the name of the LORD.

[^18]: 4:1 Cain sounds like the Hebrew for acquired or brought forth.
[^19]: 4:7 Or it desires to control you
[^20]: 4:8 SP, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; Hebrew Then Cain spoke to his brother Abel.
[^21]: 4:13 Or guilt or sin
[^22]: 4:15 LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac; Hebrew “Very well!” or “Therefore:”
[^23]: 4:16 Nod means wandering.
[^24]: 4:24 Hebrew; LXX can be translated as either seventy times seven or seventy-sevenfold; see also Matthew 18:22.
[^25]: 4:25 Seth probably means granted or appointed.
[^26]: 4:26 Or to proclaim; some translators to invoke or to call themselves by or to profane
