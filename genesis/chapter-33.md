# Chapter 33

## Jacob Meets Esau

**¹** Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.

**²** He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.

**³** But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.

**⁴** Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.

**⁵** When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.”

**⁶** Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.

**⁷** Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.

**⁸** “What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. “To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered.

**⁹** “I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.”

**¹⁰** But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably.

**¹¹** Please accept my gift [^156] that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted.

**¹²** Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.”

**¹³** But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die.

**¹⁴** Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”

**¹⁵** “Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”

**¹⁶** So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,

**¹⁷** but Jacob went on to Succoth,[^157] where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.

## Jacob Settles in Shechem

**¹⁸** After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram,[^158] he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city.

**¹⁹** And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.[^159]

**²⁰** There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.[^160]

[^156]: 33:11 Or blessing or treaty of peace
[^157]: 33:17 Succoth means booths or shelters or tabernacles; twice in this verse.
[^158]: 33:18 That is, northwest Mesopotamia
[^159]: 33:19 Hebrew a hundred kesitahs; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known
[^160]: 33:20 El-Elohe-Israel means God is the God of Israel or mighty is the God of Israel.
