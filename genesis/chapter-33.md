# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. 

<sup>2</sup> He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 

<sup>3</sup> But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 

<sup>4</sup> Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept. 

<sup>5</sup> When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.” 

<sup>6</sup> Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down. 

<sup>7</sup> Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down. 

<sup>8</sup> “What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. “To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered. 

<sup>9</sup> “I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.” 

<sup>10</sup> But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably. 

<sup>11</sup> Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted. 

<sup>12</sup> Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.” 

<sup>13</sup> But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die. 

<sup>14</sup> Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.” 

<sup>15</sup> “Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” 

<sup>16</sup> So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir, 

<sup>17</sup> but Jacob went on to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth. 

<sup>18</sup> After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city. 

<sup>19</sup> And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. 

<sup>20</sup> There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
