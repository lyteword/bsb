# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood. 

<sup>2</sup> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 

<sup>3</sup> The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 

<sup>4</sup> And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites. 

<sup>5</sup> From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations. 

<sup>6</sup> The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 

<sup>7</sup> The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 

<sup>8</sup> Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.” 

<sup>10</sup> His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

<sup>11</sup> From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 

<sup>12</sup> and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah. 

<sup>13</sup> Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites, 

<sup>14</sup> the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites. 

<sup>15</sup> And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, 

<sup>16</sup> the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 

<sup>17</sup> the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 

<sup>18</sup> the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered, 

<sup>19</sup> and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 

<sup>20</sup> These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. 

<sup>21</sup> And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber. 

<sup>22</sup> The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 

<sup>23</sup> The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 

<sup>24</sup> Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber. 

<sup>25</sup> Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan. 

<sup>26</sup> And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 

<sup>27</sup> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 

<sup>28</sup> Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 

<sup>29</sup> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. 

<sup>30</sup> Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country. 

<sup>31</sup> These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. 

<sup>32</sup> All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
