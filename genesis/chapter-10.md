# Chapter 10

## The Table of Nations

**(1 Chronicles 1:4–27)**

**¹** This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood.

## The Japhethites

**²** The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.

**³** The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

**⁴** And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites.[^44]

**⁵** From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations.

## The Hamites

**⁶** The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

**⁷** The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah,[^45] Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

**⁸** Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one [^46] on the earth.

**⁹** He was a mighty hunter before [^47] the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”

**¹⁰** His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.[^48]

**¹¹** From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,

**¹²** and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.

**¹³** Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,

**¹⁴** the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites.[^49]

**¹⁵** And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn,[^50] and of the Hittites,

**¹⁶** the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,

**¹⁷** the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,

**¹⁸** the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered,

**¹⁹** and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.

**²⁰** These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

## The Semites

**²¹** And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth;[^51] Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber.

**²²** The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

**²³** The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.[^52]

**²⁴** Arphaxad was the father of Shelah,[^53] and Shelah was the father of Eber.

**²⁵** Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg,[^54] because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.

**²⁶** And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,

**²⁷** Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

**²⁸** Obal, Abimael, Sheba,

**²⁹** Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.

**³⁰** Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country.

**³¹** These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

**³²** All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
