# Chapter 25

## Abraham and Keturah

**(1 Chronicles 1:32–33)**

**¹** Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,

**²** and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

**³** Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.

**⁴** The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.

**⁵** Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.

**⁶** But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.

## The Death of Abraham

**⁷** Abraham lived a total of 175 years.

**⁸** And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.

**⁹** His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.

**¹⁰** This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.

**¹¹** After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.

## The Descendants of Ishmael

**(1 Chronicles 1:28–31)**

**¹²** This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.

**¹³** These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

**¹⁴** Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

**¹⁵** Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

**¹⁶** These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.

**¹⁷** Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.

**¹⁸** Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur.[^110] And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.

## Jacob and Esau

**(Malachi 1:1–5; Romans 9:6–29)**

**¹⁹** This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,

**²⁰** and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram [^111] and the sister of Laban the Aramean.

**²¹** Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.

**²²** But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,

**²³** and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”[^112]

**²⁴** When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.

**²⁵** The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.[^113]

**²⁶** After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.[^114] And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.

**²⁷** When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.

**²⁸** Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.

## Esau Sells His Birthright

**²⁹** One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.

**³⁰** He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.[^115])

**³¹** “First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.

**³²** “Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”

**³³** “Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.

**³⁴** Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.

[^113]: 25:25 Esau sounds like a Hebrew term that means hairy.
[^114]: 25:26 Jacob means he grasps the heel or he deceives.
