# Chapter 25

## Abraham and Keturah

**(1 Chronicles 1:32–33)**

<sup>1</sup> Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,

<sup>2</sup> and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

<sup>3</sup> Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.

<sup>4</sup> The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.

<sup>5</sup> Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.

<sup>6</sup> But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.

## The Death of Abraham

<sup>7</sup> Abraham lived a total of 175 years.

<sup>8</sup> And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.

<sup>9</sup> His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.

<sup>10</sup> This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.

<sup>11</sup> After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.

## The Descendants of Ishmael

**(1 Chronicles 1:28–31)**

<sup>12</sup> This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.

<sup>13</sup> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

<sup>14</sup> Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

<sup>15</sup> Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

<sup>16</sup> These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.

<sup>17</sup> Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.

<sup>18</sup> Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur.[^110] And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.

## Jacob and Esau

**(Malachi 1:1–5; Romans 9:6–29)**

<sup>19</sup> This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,

<sup>20</sup> and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram [^111] and the sister of Laban the Aramean.

<sup>21</sup> Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.

<sup>22</sup> But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,

<sup>23</sup> and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”[^112]

<sup>24</sup> When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.

<sup>25</sup> The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.[^113]

<sup>26</sup> After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.[^114] And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.

<sup>27</sup> When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.

<sup>28</sup> Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.

## Esau Sells His Birthright

<sup>29</sup> One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.

<sup>30</sup> He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.[^115])

<sup>31</sup> “First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.

<sup>32</sup> “Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”

<sup>33</sup> “Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.

<sup>34</sup> Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.

[^111]: 25:20 That is, northwest Mesopotamia
[^112]: 25:23 Cited in Romans 9:12
[^113]: 25:25 Esau sounds like a Hebrew term that means hairy.
[^114]: 25:26 Jacob means he grasps the heel or he deceives.
[^115]: 25:30 Edom means red.
