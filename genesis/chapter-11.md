# Chapter 11

## The Tower of Babel

**(Deuteronomy 32:8; Acts 2:1–13)**

**¹** Now the whole world had one language and a common form of speech.

**²** And as people journeyed eastward,[^55] they found a plain in the land of Shinar [^56] and settled there.

**³** And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” So they used brick instead of stone, and tar instead of mortar.

**⁴** “Come,” they said, “let us build for ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of all the earth.”

**⁵** Then the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building.

**⁶** And the LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people speaking the same language, then nothing they devise will be beyond them.

**⁷** Come, let Us go down and confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”

**⁸** So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth, and they stopped building the city.

**⁹** That is why it is called Babel,[^57] for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world, and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth.

[^55]: 11:2 Or from the east or in the east
[^56]: 11:2 That is, Babylonia
[^57]: 11:9 Or Babylon; the Hebrew word for Babel sounds like the Hebrew for confused.
[^58]: 11:13 Hebrew; LXX (see also Luke 3:35–36) 12 When Arphaxad was 135 years old, he became the father of Cainan. 13 And after he had become the father of Cainan, Arphaxad lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters, and then he died. When Cainan had lived 130 years, he became the father of Shelah. And after he had become the father of Shelah, Cainan lived 330 years and had other sons and daughters. Note that LXX also adds 100 years to the ages of Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, and Nahor in this genealogy.
