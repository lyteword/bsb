# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> In that day you will say: “O LORD, I will praise You. Although You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation.” 

<sup>3</sup> With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation, 

<sup>4</sup> and on that day you will say: “Give praise to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted. 

<sup>5</sup> Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> Cry out and sing, O citizen of Zion, for great among you is the Holy One of Israel.”
