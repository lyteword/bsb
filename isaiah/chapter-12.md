**²** Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation.”

**³** With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,

**⁴** and on that day you will say: “Give praise to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted.

**⁵** Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth.
