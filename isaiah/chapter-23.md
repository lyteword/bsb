# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> This is the burden against Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor. Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus. 

<sup>2</sup> Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, whose traders have crossed the sea. 

<sup>3</sup> On the great waters came the grain of Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; she was the merchant of the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken: “I have not been in labor or given birth. I have not raised young men or brought up young women.” 

<sup>5</sup> When the report reaches Egypt, they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre. 

<sup>6</sup> Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coastland! 

<sup>7</sup> Is this your jubilant city, whose origin is from antiquity, whose feet have taken her to settle far away? 

<sup>8</sup> Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose traders are princes, whose merchants are renowned on the earth? 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD of Hosts planned it, to defile all its glorious beauty, to disgrace all the renowned of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Cultivate your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer a harbor. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; He has made kingdoms tremble. He has given a command that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed. 

<sup>12</sup> He said, “You shall rejoice no more, O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Get up and cross over to Cyprus— even there you will find no rest.” 

<sup>13</sup> Look at the land of the Chaldeans — a people now of no account. The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They brought it to ruin. 

<sup>14</sup> Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your harbor has been destroyed! 

<sup>15</sup> At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot: 

<sup>16</sup> “Take up your harp, stroll through the city, O forgotten harlot. Make sweet melody, sing many a song, so you will be remembered.” 

<sup>17</sup> And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. 

<sup>18</sup> Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.
