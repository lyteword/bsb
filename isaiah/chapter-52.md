# Chapter 52

## Deliverance for Jerusalem

**¹** Awake, awake, clothe yourself with strength, O Zion! Put on your garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, holy city! For the uncircumcised and unclean will no longer enter you.

**²** Shake off your dust! Rise up and sit on your throne, O Jerusalem. Remove the chains from your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.

**³** For this is what the LORD says: “You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.”

**⁴** For this is what the Lord GOD says: “At first My people went down to Egypt to live, then Assyria oppressed them without cause.

**⁵** And now what have I here? declares the LORD. For My people have been taken without cause; those who rule them taunt,[^2735] declares the LORD, and My name is blasphemed continually all day long.[^2736]

**⁶** Therefore My people will know My name; therefore they will know on that day that I am He who speaks. Here I am!”

**⁷** How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news,[^2737] who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!”

**⁸** Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices, together they shout for joy. For every eye will see when the LORD returns to Zion.

**⁹** Break forth in joy, sing together, O ruins of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.

**¹⁰** The LORD has bared His holy arm in the sight of all the nations; all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.

**¹¹** Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing;[^2738] come out from it, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.

**¹²** For you will not leave in a hurry nor flee in haste, for the LORD goes before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard.

## The Servant Exalted

**(Philippians 2:5–11)**

**¹³** Behold, My Servant will prosper;[^2739] He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.

**¹⁴** Just as many were appalled at Him [^2740]— His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man, and His form was marred beyond human likeness—

**¹⁵** so He will sprinkle [^2741] many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him. For they will see what they have not been told, and they will understand what they have not heard.[^2742]
