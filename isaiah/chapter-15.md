## The Burden against Moab

**(Jeremiah 48:1–47)**

<sup>1</sup> This is the burden against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!

<sup>2</sup> Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.

<sup>3</sup> In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.

<sup>4</sup> Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.

<sup>5</sup> My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah.[^2617] With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.

<sup>6</sup> The waters of Nimrim are dried up, and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone, and the greenery is no more.

<sup>7</sup> So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.[^2618]

<sup>8</sup> For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.

<sup>9</sup> The waters of Dimon [^2619] are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimon— a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.

[^2617]: 15:5 Or Zoar, like a heifer three years of age.
[^2618]: 15:7 Or Poplars
[^2619]: 15:9 MT, twice in this verse; DSS and Vulgate Dibon; Dimon, a wordplay on Dibon (see verse 2), sounds like the Hebrew for blood.
