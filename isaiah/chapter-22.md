# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the rooftops, 

<sup>2</sup> O city of commotion, O town of revelry? Your slain did not die by the sword, nor were they killed in battle. 

<sup>3</sup> All your rulers have fled together, captured without a bow. All your fugitives were captured together, having fled to a distant place. 

<sup>4</sup> Therefore I said, “Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! Do not try to console me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.” 

<sup>5</sup> For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision— of breaking down the walls and crying to the mountains. 

<sup>6</sup> Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovers the shield. 

<sup>7</sup> Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the gates. 

<sup>8</sup> He has uncovered the defenses of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest. 

<sup>9</sup> You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool. 

<sup>10</sup> You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall. 

<sup>11</sup> You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago. 

<sup>12</sup> On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts called for weeping and wailing, for shaven heads and the wearing of sackcloth. 

<sup>13</sup> But look, there is joy and gladness, butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: “Until your dying day, this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” 

<sup>15</sup> This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace: 

<sup>16</sup> What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock? 

<sup>17</sup> Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you, 

<sup>18</sup> roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master. 

<sup>19</sup> I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position. 

<sup>20</sup> On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 

<sup>21</sup> I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 

<sup>22</sup> I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. 

<sup>23</sup> I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father. 

<sup>24</sup> So they will hang on him the whole burden of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar. 

<sup>25</sup> In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
