# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received: 

<sup>2</sup> Raise a banner on a barren hilltop; call aloud to them. Wave your hand, that they may enter the gates of the nobles. 

<sup>3</sup> I have commanded My sanctified ones; I have even summoned My warriors to execute My wrath and exult in My triumph. 

<sup>4</sup> Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations gathered together! The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing an army for war. 

<sup>5</sup> They are coming from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens— the LORD and the weapons of His wrath— to destroy the whole country. 

<sup>6</sup> Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near; it will come as destruction from the Almighty. 

<sup>7</sup> Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt. 

<sup>8</sup> Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming— cruel, with fury and burning anger— to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners within it. 

<sup>10</sup> For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. 

<sup>11</sup> I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant and lay low the pride of the ruthless. 

<sup>12</sup> I will make man scarcer than pure gold, and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir. 

<sup>13</sup> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts on the day of His burning anger. 

<sup>14</sup> Like a hunted gazelle, like a sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land. 

<sup>15</sup> Whoever is caught will be stabbed, and whoever is captured will die by the sword. 

<sup>16</sup> Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be ravished. 

<sup>17</sup> Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who have no regard for silver and no desire for gold. 

<sup>18</sup> Their bows will dash young men to pieces; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; they will not look with pity on the children. 

<sup>19</sup> And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. 

<sup>20</sup> She will never be inhabited or settled from generation to generation; no nomad will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flock there. 

<sup>21</sup> But desert creatures will lie down there, and howling creatures will fill her houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about. 

<sup>22</sup> Hyenas will howl in her fortresses and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.
