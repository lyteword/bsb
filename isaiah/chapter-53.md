# Chapter 53

## The Suffering Servant

**(Acts 8:26–40; 1 Peter 2:21–25)**

<sup>1</sup> Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?[^2743]

<sup>2</sup> He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no stately form or majesty to attract us, no beauty that we should desire Him.

<sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.

<sup>4</sup> Surely He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows;[^2744] yet we considered Him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.

<sup>5</sup> But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.[^2745]

<sup>6</sup> We all like sheep have gone astray,[^2746] each one has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all.

<sup>7</sup> He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth.

<sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment He was taken away, and who can recount His descendants? For He was cut off from the land of the living;[^2747] He was stricken for the transgression of My people.

## A Grave Assigned

**(Matthew 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56; John 19:38–42)**

<sup>9</sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.[^2748]

<sup>10</sup> Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush Him and to cause Him to suffer; and when His soul is made a guilt offering,[^2749] He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.

<sup>11</sup> After the anguish of His soul, He will see the light of life [^2750] and be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant will justify many, and He will bear their iniquities.

<sup>12</sup> Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great,[^2751] and He will divide the spoils with the strong,[^2752] because He has poured out His life unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors.[^2753] Yet He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.
