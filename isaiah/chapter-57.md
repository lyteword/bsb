# Chapter 57

## The Blessed Death of the Righteous

**¹** The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; devout men are taken away, while no one considers that the righteous are taken away from the presence of evil.

**²** Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest, lying down in death.

## God Condemns Idolatry

**³** “But come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!

**⁴** Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit,

**⁵** who burn with lust among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?

**⁶** Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; indeed, they are your lot. Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering. Should I relent because of these?

**⁷** On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifices.

**⁸** Behind the door and doorpost you have set up your memorial. Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; you climbed up and opened it wide. And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; you have gazed upon their nakedness.

**⁹** You went to Molech [^2762] with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You have sent your envoys [^2763] a great distance; you have descended even to Sheol itself.

**¹⁰** You are wearied by your many journeys, but you did not say, “There is no hope!” You found renewal of your strength; therefore you did not grow weak.

**¹¹** Whom have you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and failed to remember Me or take this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear Me?

**¹²** I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not profit you.

**¹³** When you cry out, let your companies of idols deliver you! Yet the wind will carry off all of them, a breath will take them away. But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.”

## Healing for the Repentant

**¹⁴** And it will be said, “Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”

**¹⁵** For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and humble in spirit, to restore the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the contrite.

**¹⁶** For I will not accuse you forever, nor will I always be angry; for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me— the breath of life I have made.

**¹⁷** I was enraged by his sinful greed, so I struck him and hid My face in anger; yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart.

**¹⁸** I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,

**¹⁹** bringing praise to their lips. Peace, peace to those far and near,” says the LORD, “and I will heal them.”

**²⁰** But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its waves churn up mire and muck.

**²¹** “There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
