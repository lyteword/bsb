# Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still, until her righteousness shines like a bright light, her salvation like a blazing torch. 

<sup>2</sup> Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow. 

<sup>3</sup> You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, a royal diadem in the palm of your God. 

<sup>4</sup> No longer will you be called Forsaken, nor your land named Desolate; but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be His bride. 

<sup>5</sup> For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you. 

<sup>6</sup> On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD shall take no rest for yourselves, 

<sup>7</sup> nor give Him any rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain to your enemies for food, nor will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled. 

<sup>9</sup> For those who harvest grain will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather grapes will drink the wine in My holy courts.” 

<sup>10</sup> Go out, go out through the gates; prepare the way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones; raise a banner for the nations! 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, “Say to Daughter Zion: See, your Savior comes! Look, His reward is with Him, and His recompense goes before Him.” 

<sup>12</sup> And they will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of The LORD; and you will be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
