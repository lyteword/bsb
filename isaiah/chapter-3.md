# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of food and water, 

<sup>2</sup> the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder, 

<sup>3</sup> the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter. 

<sup>4</sup> “I will make mere lads their leaders, and children will rule over them.” 

<sup>5</sup> The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the young will rise up against the old, and the base against the honorable. 

<sup>6</sup> A man will seize his brother within his father’s house: “You have a cloak—you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of rubble.” 

<sup>7</sup> On that day he will cry aloud: “I am not a healer. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me leader of the people!” 

<sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they spoke and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence. 

<sup>9</sup> The expression on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; they do not conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought disaster upon themselves. 

<sup>10</sup> Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor. 

<sup>11</sup> Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done. 

<sup>12</sup> Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. O My people, your guides mislead you; they turn you from your paths. 

<sup>13</sup> The LORD arises to contend; He stands to judge the people. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people: “You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses. 

<sup>15</sup> Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?” 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD also says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty— walking with heads held high and wanton eyes, prancing and skipping as they go, jingling the bracelets on their ankles— 

<sup>17</sup> the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.” 

<sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents; 

<sup>19</sup> their pendants, bracelets, and veils; 

<sup>20</sup> their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms; 

<sup>21</sup> their signet rings and nose rings; 

<sup>22</sup> their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses; 

<sup>23</sup> and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls. 

<sup>24</sup> Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame. 

<sup>25</sup> Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle. 

<sup>26</sup> And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
