# Chapter 46

## Babylon’s Idols

<sup>1</sup> Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. Their idols weigh down beasts and cattle. The images you carry are burdensome, a load to the weary animal.

<sup>2</sup> The gods cower; they crouch together, unable to relieve the burden; but they themselves go into captivity.

<sup>3</sup> “Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been sustained from the womb, carried along since birth.

<sup>4</sup> Even to your old age, I will be the same, and I will bear you up when you turn gray. I have made you, and I will carry you; I will sustain you and deliver you.

<sup>5</sup> To whom will you liken Me or count Me equal? To whom will you compare Me, that we should be alike?

<sup>6</sup> They pour out their bags of gold and weigh out silver on scales; they hire a goldsmith to fashion it into a god, so they can bow down and worship.

<sup>7</sup> They lift it to their shoulder and carry it along; they set it in its place, and there it stands, not budging from that spot. They cry out to it, but it does not answer; it saves no one from his troubles.

<sup>8</sup> Remember this and be brave; take it to heart, you transgressors!

<sup>9</sup> Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me.

<sup>10</sup> I declare the end from the beginning, and from ancient times what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and all My good pleasure I will accomplish.’

<sup>11</sup> I summon a bird of prey from the east, a man for My purpose from a far-off land. Truly I have spoken, and truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, and I will surely do it.

<sup>12</sup> Listen to Me, you stubborn people, far removed from righteousness:

<sup>13</sup> I am bringing My righteousness near; it is not far away, and My salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion and adorn Israel with My splendor.
