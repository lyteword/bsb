# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice. 

<sup>2</sup> Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land. 

<sup>3</sup> Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen. 

<sup>4</sup> The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently. 

<sup>5</sup> No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected. 

<sup>6</sup> For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink. 

<sup>7</sup> The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just. 

<sup>8</sup> But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes. 

<sup>9</sup> Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters. 

<sup>10</sup> In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive. 

<sup>11</sup> Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists. 

<sup>12</sup> Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines, 

<sup>13</sup> and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers— even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry. 

<sup>14</sup> For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever— the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks— 

<sup>15</sup> until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest. 

<sup>16</sup> Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field. 

<sup>17</sup> The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever. 

<sup>18</sup> Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest. 

<sup>19</sup> But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths. 

<sup>20</sup> Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.
