## Praise to the Victorious God

**(Jeremiah 51:15–19)**

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, You are my God! I will exalt You; I will praise Your name. For You have worked wonders— plans formed long ago— in perfect faithfulness.

<sup>2</sup> Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin. The fortress of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.

<sup>3</sup> Therefore, a strong people will honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.

<sup>4</sup> For You have been a refuge for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,

<sup>5</sup> like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, so the song of the ruthless is silenced.

<sup>6</sup> On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.

<sup>7</sup> On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;

<sup>8</sup> He will swallow up death forever.[^2643] The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face [^2644] and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth. For the LORD has spoken.

<sup>9</sup> And in that day it will be said, “Surely this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”

<sup>10</sup> For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trodden into the dung pile.

<sup>11</sup> He will spread out his hands within it, as a swimmer spreads his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, despite [^2645] the skill of his hands.

<sup>12</sup> The high-walled fortress will be brought down, cast to the ground, into the dust.
