# Chapter 6

## Isaiah’s Commission

**(Matthew 13:10–17; Mark 4:10–12; Acts 28:16–31)**

<sup>1</sup> In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe [^2569] filled the temple.

<sup>2</sup> Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.

<sup>3</sup> And they were calling out to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory.”

<sup>4</sup> At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.

<sup>5</sup> Then I said: “Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.”

<sup>6</sup> Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.

<sup>7</sup> And with it he touched my mouth and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for.”

<sup>8</sup> Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?” And I said: “Here am I. Send me!”

<sup>9</sup> And He replied: “Go and tell this people, ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’[^2570]

<sup>10</sup> Make the hearts of this people calloused; deafen their ears and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.[^2571]”

<sup>11</sup> Then I asked: “How long, O Lord?” And He replied: “Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left unoccupied and the land is desolate and ravaged,

<sup>12</sup> until the LORD has driven men far away and the land is utterly forsaken.

<sup>13</sup> And though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”

[^2571]: 6:10 Hebrew; LXX For this people’s heart has grown callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.
