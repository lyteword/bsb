# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> “For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of Hosts. “Not a root or branch will be left to them.” 

<sup>2</sup> “But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall. 

<sup>3</sup> Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing,” says the LORD of Hosts. 

<sup>4</sup> “Remember the law of My servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome Day of the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.”
