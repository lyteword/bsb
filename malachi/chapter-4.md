# Chapter 4

## The Day of the LORD

**(Zephaniah 1:7–18; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11; 2 Peter 3:8–13)**

<sup>1</sup> “For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of Hosts. “Not a root or branch will be left to them.”

<sup>2</sup> “But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings,[^3539] and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall.

<sup>3</sup> Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing,” says the LORD of Hosts.

<sup>4</sup> “Remember the law of My servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.[^3540]

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome [^3541] Day of the LORD.

<sup>6</sup> And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers.[^3542] Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.”
