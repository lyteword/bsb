# Chapter 22

## A Good Name

<sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold.

<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common: The LORD is Maker of them all.

<sup>3</sup> The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.

<sup>4</sup> The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD are wealth and honor and life.

<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul stays far from them.

<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.

<sup>7</sup> The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.

<sup>8</sup> He who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.[^2496]

<sup>9</sup> A generous man [^2497] will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.

<sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart; even quarreling and insults will cease.

<sup>11</sup> He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips will have the king for a friend.

<sup>12</sup> The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He frustrates the words of the faithless.

<sup>13</sup> The slacker says, “There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!”

<sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the wrath of the LORD will fall into it.

<sup>15</sup> Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.

<sup>16</sup> Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich will surely lead to poverty.

## Thirty Sayings of the Wise

## Saying 1

<sup>17</sup> Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise— apply your mind to my knowledge—

<sup>18</sup> for it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips.

<sup>19</sup> So that your trust may be in the LORD, I instruct you today—yes, you.

<sup>20</sup> Have I not written for you thirty sayings [^2498] about counsel and knowledge,

<sup>21</sup> to show you true and reliable words, that you may soundly answer those who sent you?

## Saying 2

<sup>22</sup> Do not rob a poor man because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,

<sup>23</sup> for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who rob them.

## Saying 3

<sup>24</sup> Do not make friends with an angry man, and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,

<sup>25</sup> or you may learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.

## Saying 4

<sup>26</sup> Do not be one who gives pledges, who puts up security for debts.

<sup>27</sup> If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?

## Saying 5

<sup>28</sup> Do not move an ancient boundary stone which your fathers have placed.

## Saying 6

<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will be stationed in the presence of kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
