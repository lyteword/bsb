# Chapter 22

## A Good Name

**¹** A good name is more desirable than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold.

**²** The rich and the poor have this in common: The LORD is Maker of them all.

**³** The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.

**⁴** The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD are wealth and honor and life.

**⁵** Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul stays far from them.

**⁶** Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.

**⁷** The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.

**⁸** He who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.[^2496]

**⁹** A generous man [^2497] will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.

**¹⁰** Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart; even quarreling and insults will cease.

**¹¹** He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips will have the king for a friend.

**¹²** The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He frustrates the words of the faithless.

**¹³** The slacker says, “There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!”

**¹⁴** The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the wrath of the LORD will fall into it.

**¹⁵** Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.

**¹⁶** Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich will surely lead to poverty.

## Thirty Sayings of the Wise

## Saying 1

**¹⁷** Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise— apply your mind to my knowledge—

**¹⁸** for it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips.

**¹⁹** So that your trust may be in the LORD, I instruct you today—yes, you.

**²⁰** Have I not written for you thirty sayings [^2498] about counsel and knowledge,

**²¹** to show you true and reliable words, that you may soundly answer those who sent you?

## Saying 2

**²²** Do not rob a poor man because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,

**²³** for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who rob them.

## Saying 3

**²⁴** Do not make friends with an angry man, and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,

**²⁵** or you may learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.

## Saying 4

**²⁶** Do not be one who gives pledges, who puts up security for debts.

**²⁷** If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?

## Saying 5

**²⁸** Do not move an ancient boundary stone which your fathers have placed.

## Saying 6

**²⁹** Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will be stationed in the presence of kings; he will not stand before obscure men.

[^2496]: 22:8 LXX includes God blesses a cheerful and generous man, but foolish works will come to an end; see also 2 Corinthians 9:7.
[^2497]: 22:9 Literally He whose eye is good
[^2498]: 22:20 Or written for you excellent sayings or written for you three times
