# Chapter 18

## The Selfishness of the Unfriendly

<sup>1</sup> He who isolates himself pursues selfish desires; he rebels against all sound judgment.

<sup>2</sup> A fool does not delight in understanding, but only in airing his opinions.

<sup>3</sup> With a wicked man comes contempt as well, and shame is accompanied by disgrace.

<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.

<sup>5</sup> Showing partiality [^2486] to the wicked is not good, nor is depriving the innocent of justice.

<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips bring him strife, and his mouth invites a beating.

<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his ruin, and his lips are a snare to his soul.

<sup>8</sup> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.

<sup>9</sup> Whoever is slothful in his work is brother to him who destroys.

<sup>10</sup> The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it [^2487] and are safe.

<sup>11</sup> A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city; it is like a high wall in his imagination.

<sup>12</sup> Before his downfall a man’s heart is proud, but humility comes before honor.

<sup>13</sup> He who answers a matter before he hears it— this is folly and disgrace to him.

<sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man can endure his sickness, but who can survive a broken spirit?

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks it out.

<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift opens doors for him, and brings him before great men.

<sup>17</sup> The first to state his case seems right until another comes and cross-examines him.

<sup>18</sup> Casting the lot ends quarrels and separates strong opponents.

<sup>19</sup> An offended brother is harder to win than a fortified city, and disputes are like the bars of a castle.

<sup>20</sup> From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.

<sup>21</sup> Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

<sup>22</sup> He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.

<sup>23</sup> The poor man pleads for mercy, but the rich man answers harshly.

<sup>24</sup> A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother.
