# Chapter 18

## The Selfishness of the Unfriendly

**¹** He who isolates himself pursues selfish desires; he rebels against all sound judgment.

**²** A fool does not delight in understanding, but only in airing his opinions.

**³** With a wicked man comes contempt as well, and shame is accompanied by disgrace.

**⁴** The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.

**⁵** Showing partiality [^2486] to the wicked is not good, nor is depriving the innocent of justice.

**⁶** A fool’s lips bring him strife, and his mouth invites a beating.

**⁷** A fool’s mouth is his ruin, and his lips are a snare to his soul.

**⁸** The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.

**⁹** Whoever is slothful in his work is brother to him who destroys.

**¹⁰** The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it [^2487] and are safe.

**¹¹** A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city; it is like a high wall in his imagination.

**¹²** Before his downfall a man’s heart is proud, but humility comes before honor.

**¹³** He who answers a matter before he hears it— this is folly and disgrace to him.

**¹⁴** The spirit of a man can endure his sickness, but who can survive a broken spirit?

**¹⁵** The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks it out.

**¹⁶** A man’s gift opens doors for him, and brings him before great men.

**¹⁷** The first to state his case seems right until another comes and cross-examines him.

**¹⁸** Casting the lot ends quarrels and separates strong opponents.

**¹⁹** An offended brother is harder to win than a fortified city, and disputes are like the bars of a castle.

**²⁰** From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.

**²¹** Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

**²²** He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.

**²³** The poor man pleads for mercy, but the rich man answers harshly.

**²⁴** A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother.
