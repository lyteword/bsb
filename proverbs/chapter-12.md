# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid. 

<sup>2</sup> The good man obtains favor from the LORD, but the LORD condemns a man who devises evil. 

<sup>3</sup> A man cannot be established through wickedness, but the righteous cannot be uprooted. 

<sup>4</sup> A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but she who causes shame is like decay in his bones. 

<sup>5</sup> The plans of the righteous are just, but the counsel of the wicked leads to deceit. 

<sup>6</sup> The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them. 

<sup>7</sup> The wicked are overthrown and perish, but the house of the righteous will stand. 

<sup>8</sup> A man is praised according to his wisdom, but a twisted mind is despised. 

<sup>9</sup> Better to be lightly esteemed yet have a servant, than to be self-important but lack food. 

<sup>10</sup> A righteous man regards the life of his animal, but the tender mercies of the wicked are only cruelty. 

<sup>11</sup> The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies lacks judgment. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked desire the plunder of evil men, but the root of the righteous flourishes. 

<sup>13</sup> An evil man is trapped by his rebellious speech, but a righteous man escapes from trouble. 

<sup>14</sup> By fruitful speech a man is filled with good things, and the work of his hands returns to him. 

<sup>15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to counsel. 

<sup>16</sup> A fool’s anger is known at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult. 

<sup>17</sup> He who speaks the truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit. 

<sup>18</sup> Speaking rashly is like a piercing sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. 

<sup>19</sup> Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment. 

<sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the hearts of those who devise evil, but the counselors of peace have joy. 

<sup>21</sup> No harm befalls the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble. 

<sup>22</sup> Lying lips are detestable to the LORD, but those who deal faithfully are His delight. 

<sup>23</sup> A shrewd man keeps his knowledge to himself, but a foolish heart proclaims its folly. 

<sup>24</sup> The hand of the diligent will rule, but laziness ends in forced labor. 

<sup>25</sup> Anxiety weighs down the heart of a man, but a good word cheers it up. 

<sup>26</sup> A righteous man is cautious in friendship, but the ways of the wicked lead them astray. 

<sup>27</sup> A lazy man does not roast his game, but a diligent man prizes his possession. 

<sup>28</sup> There is life in the path of righteousness, but another path leads to death.
