# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> A man who remains stiff-necked after much reproof will suddenly be shattered beyond recovery. 

<sup>2</sup> When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan. 

<sup>3</sup> A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. 

<sup>4</sup> By justice a king brings stability to the land, but a man who exacts tribute demolishes it. 

<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet. 

<sup>6</sup> An evil man is caught by his own sin, but a righteous one sings and rejoices. 

<sup>7</sup> The righteous consider the cause of the poor, but the wicked have no regard for such concerns. 

<sup>8</sup> Mockers inflame a city, but the wise turn away anger. 

<sup>9</sup> If a wise man goes to court with a fool, there will be raving and laughing with no resolution. 

<sup>10</sup> Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man, but the upright care for his life. 

<sup>11</sup> A fool vents all his anger, but a wise man holds it back. 

<sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials will be wicked. 

<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. 

<sup>14</sup> A king who judges the poor with fairness— his throne will be established forever. 

<sup>15</sup> A rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother. 

<sup>16</sup> When the wicked thrive, rebellion increases; but the righteous will see their downfall. 

<sup>17</sup> Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will bring delight to your soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the Law. 

<sup>19</sup> A servant cannot be corrected by words alone; though he understands, he will not respond. 

<sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 

<sup>21</sup> A servant pampered from his youth will bring grief in the end. 

<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression. 

<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor. 

<sup>24</sup> A partner to a thief hates his own soul; he receives the oath, but does not testify. 

<sup>25</sup> The fear of man is a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is set securely on high. 

<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man receives justice from the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> An unjust man is detestable to the righteous, and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.
