# Chapter 29

## The Flourishing of the Righteous

**¹** A man who remains stiff-necked after much reproof will suddenly be shattered beyond recovery.

**²** When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.

**³** A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.

**⁴** By justice a king brings stability to the land, but a man who exacts tribute [^2516] demolishes it.

**⁵** A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.

**⁶** An evil man is caught by his own sin, but a righteous one sings and rejoices.

**⁷** The righteous consider the cause of the poor, but the wicked have no regard for such concerns.

**⁸** Mockers inflame a city, but the wise turn away anger.

**⁹** If a wise man goes to court with a fool, there will be raving and laughing with no resolution.

**¹⁰** Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man, but the upright care for his life.[^2517]

**¹¹** A fool vents all his anger, but a wise man holds it back.

**¹²** If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials will be wicked.

**¹³** The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both.

**¹⁴** A king who judges the poor with fairness— his throne will be established forever.

**¹⁵** A rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother.

**¹⁶** When the wicked thrive, rebellion increases; but the righteous will see their downfall.

**¹⁷** Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will bring delight to your soul.

**¹⁸** Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the Law.

**¹⁹** A servant cannot be corrected by words alone; though he understands, he will not respond.

**²⁰** Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

**²¹** A servant pampered from his youth will bring grief in the end.

**²²** An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.

**²³** A man’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.

**²⁴** A partner to a thief hates his own soul; he receives the oath but does not testify.

**²⁵** The fear of man is a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is set securely on high.

**²⁶** Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man receives justice from the LORD.

**²⁷** An unjust man is detestable to the righteous, and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.

[^2516]: 29:4 Or who taxes heavily or who takes bribes
[^2517]: 29:10 Or but the upright seek his soul
