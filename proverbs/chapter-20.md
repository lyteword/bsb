# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler, and whoever is led astray by them is not wise. 

<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion; whoever provokes him forfeits his own life. 

<sup>3</sup> It is honorable for a man to resolve a dispute, but any fool will quarrel. 

<sup>4</sup> The slacker does not plow in season; at harvest time he looks, but nothing is there. 

<sup>5</sup> The intentions of a man’s heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out. 

<sup>6</sup> Many a man proclaims his loving devotion, but who can find a trustworthy man? 

<sup>7</sup> The righteous man walks with integrity; blessed are his children after him. 

<sup>8</sup> A king who sits on a throne to judge sifts out all evil with his eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin”? 

<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and unequal measures — both are detestable to the LORD. 

<sup>11</sup> Even a young man is known by his actions— whether his conduct is pure and upright. 

<sup>12</sup> Ears that hear and eyes that see— the LORD has made them both. 

<sup>13</sup> Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of food. 

<sup>14</sup> “Worthless, worthless!” says the buyer, but on the way out, he gloats. 

<sup>15</sup> There is an abundance of gold and rubies, but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure. 

<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of the one who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner. 

<sup>17</sup> Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man, but later his mouth is full of gravel. 

<sup>18</sup> Set plans by consultation, and wage war under sound guidance. 

<sup>19</sup> He who reveals secrets is a constant gossip; avoid the one who babbles with his lips. 

<sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness. 

<sup>21</sup> An inheritance gained quickly will not be blessed in the end. 

<sup>22</sup> Do not say, “I will avenge this evil!” Wait on the LORD, and He will save you. 

<sup>23</sup> Unequal weights are detestable to the LORD, and dishonest scales are no good. 

<sup>24</sup> A man’s steps are from the LORD, so how can anyone understand his own way? 

<sup>25</sup> It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly, only later to reconsider his vows. 

<sup>26</sup> A wise king separates out the wicked and drives the threshing wheel over them. 

<sup>27</sup> The spirit of a man is the lamp of the LORD, searching out his inmost being. 

<sup>28</sup> Loving devotion and faithfulness preserve a king; by these he maintains his throne. 

<sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength, and gray hair is the splendor of the old. 

<sup>30</sup> Lashes and wounds scour evil, and beatings cleanse the inmost parts.
