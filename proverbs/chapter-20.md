# Chapter 20

## Wine Is a Mocker

**¹** Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler, and whoever is led astray by them is not wise.

**²** The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion; whoever provokes him forfeits his own life.[^2488]

**³** It is honorable for a man to resolve a dispute, but any fool will quarrel.

**⁴** The slacker does not plow in season; at harvest time he looks, but nothing is there.

**⁵** The intentions of a man’s heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out.

**⁶** Many a man proclaims his loving devotion, but who can find a trustworthy man?

**⁷** The righteous man walks with integrity; blessed are his children after him.

**⁸** A king who sits on a throne to judge sifts out all evil with his eyes.

**⁹** Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin”?

**¹⁰** Differing weights and unequal measures [^2489]— both are detestable to the LORD.

**¹¹** Even a young man is known by his actions— whether his conduct is pure and upright.

**¹²** Ears that hear and eyes that see— the LORD has made them both.

**¹³** Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of food.

**¹⁴** “Worthless, worthless!” says the buyer, but on the way out, he gloats.

**¹⁵** There is an abundance of gold and rubies, but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure.

**¹⁶** Take the garment of the one who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.[^2490]

**¹⁷** Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man, but later his mouth is full of gravel.

**¹⁸** Set plans by consultation, and wage war under sound guidance.

**¹⁹** He who reveals secrets is a constant gossip; avoid the one who babbles [^2491] with his lips.

**²⁰** Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness.

**²¹** An inheritance gained quickly will not be blessed in the end.

**²²** Do not say, “I will avenge this evil!” Wait on the LORD, and He will save you.

**²³** Unequal weights are detestable to the LORD, and dishonest scales are no good.

**²⁴** A man’s steps are from the LORD, so how can anyone understand his own way?

**²⁵** It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly, only later to reconsider his vows.

**²⁶** A wise king separates out the wicked and drives the threshing wheel over them.

**²⁷** The spirit [^2492] of a man is the lamp of the LORD, searching out his inmost being.

**²⁸** Loving devotion and faithfulness preserve a king; by these he maintains his throne.

**²⁹** The glory of young men is their strength, and gray hair is the splendor of the old.

**³⁰** Lashes and wounds scour evil, and beatings cleanse the inmost parts.
