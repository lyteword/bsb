# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. 

<sup>3</sup> Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman, 

<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words. 

<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice. 

<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment, 

<sup>8</sup> crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house, 

<sup>9</sup> at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night. 

<sup>10</sup> Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart. 

<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home. 

<sup>12</sup> Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner. 

<sup>13</sup> She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him: 

<sup>14</sup> “I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you. 

<sup>16</sup> I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt. 

<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses! 

<sup>19</sup> For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey. 

<sup>20</sup> He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.” 

<sup>21</sup> With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him. 

<sup>22</sup> He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap, 

<sup>23</sup> until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare— not knowing it will cost him his life. 

<sup>24</sup> Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths. 

<sup>26</sup> For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number. 

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
