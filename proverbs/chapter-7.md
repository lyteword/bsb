## Warnings about the Adulteress

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.

<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple [^2464] of your eye.

<sup>3</sup> Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.

<sup>4</sup> Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,

<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.

<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.

<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,

<sup>8</sup> crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,

<sup>9</sup> at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.

<sup>10</sup> Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.

<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.

<sup>12</sup> Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.

<sup>13</sup> She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:

<sup>14</sup> “I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.

<sup>15</sup> So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.

<sup>16</sup> I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.

<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.

<sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!

<sup>19</sup> For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.

<sup>20</sup> He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”

<sup>21</sup> With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.

<sup>22</sup> He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,[^2465]

<sup>23</sup> until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare— not knowing it will cost him his life.

<sup>24</sup> Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.

<sup>25</sup> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.

<sup>26</sup> For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.

[^2464]: 7:2 Literally the pupil
[^2465]: 7:22 Probable reading (see LXX, Vulgate, Syriac); Hebrew like fetters to discipline a fool
