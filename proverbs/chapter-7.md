## Warnings about the Adulteress

**¹** My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.

**²** Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple [^2464] of your eye.

**³** Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.

**⁴** Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,

**⁵** that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.

**⁶** For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.

**⁷** I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,

**⁸** crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,

**⁹** at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.

**¹⁰** Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.

**¹¹** She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.

**¹²** Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.

**¹³** She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:

**¹⁴** “I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.

**¹⁵** So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.

**¹⁶** I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.

**¹⁷** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.

**¹⁸** Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!

**¹⁹** For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.

**²⁰** He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”

**²¹** With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.

**²²** He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,[^2465]

**²³** until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare— not knowing it will cost him his life.

**²⁴** Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.

**²⁵** Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.

**²⁶** For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.

**²⁷** Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.

[^2464]: 7:2 Literally the pupil
[^2465]: 7:22 Probable reading (see LXX, Vulgate, Syriac); Hebrew like fetters to discipline a fool
