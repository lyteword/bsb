# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is set before you, 

<sup>2</sup> and put a knife to your throat if you possess a great appetite. 

<sup>3</sup> Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive. 

<sup>4</sup> Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself. 

<sup>5</sup> When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky. 

<sup>6</sup> Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, and do not crave his delicacies; 

<sup>7</sup> for he is keeping track, inwardly counting the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 

<sup>8</sup> You will vomit up what little you have eaten and waste your pleasant words. 

<sup>9</sup> Do not speak to a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. 

<sup>10</sup> Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, 

<sup>11</sup> for their Redeemer is strong; He will take up their case against you. 

<sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with a rod, he will not die. 

<sup>14</sup> Strike him with a rod, and you will deliver his soul from Sheol. 

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise, my own heart will indeed rejoice. 

<sup>16</sup> My inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. 

<sup>17</sup> Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD. 

<sup>18</sup> For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 

<sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right course. 

<sup>20</sup> Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat. 

<sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags. 

<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. 

<sup>23</sup> Invest in truth and never sell it— in wisdom and instruction and understanding. 

<sup>24</sup> The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him. 

<sup>25</sup> May your father and mother be glad, and may she who gave you birth rejoice! 

<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways. 

<sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well. 

<sup>28</sup> Like a robber she lies in wait and multiplies the faithless among men. 

<sup>29</sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has needless wounds? Who has bloodshot eyes? 

<sup>30</sup> Those who linger over wine, who go to taste mixed drinks. 

<sup>31</sup> Do not gaze at wine while it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. 

<sup>32</sup> In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper. 

<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will utter perversities. 

<sup>34</sup> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas or lying on the top of a mast: 

<sup>35</sup> “They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I did not know it! When can I wake up to search for another drink?”
