## True Riches

**(1 Timothy 6:17–19; James 5:1–6)**

## Saying 7

**¹** When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is set before you,[^2499]

**²** and put a knife to your throat if you possess a great appetite.

**³** Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.

## Saying 8

**⁴** Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself.

**⁵** When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky.

## Saying 9

**⁶** Do not eat the bread of a stingy man,[^2500] and do not crave his delicacies;

**⁷** for he is keeping track, inwardly counting the cost.[^2501] “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.

**⁸** You will vomit up what little you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.

## Saying 10

**⁹** Do not speak to a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

## Saying 11

**¹⁰** Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,

**¹¹** for their Redeemer is strong; He will take up their case against you.

## Saying 12

**¹²** Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.

## Saying 13

**¹³** Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with a rod, he will not die.

**¹⁴** Strike him with a rod, and you will deliver his soul from Sheol.

## Saying 14

**¹⁵** My son, if your heart is wise, my own heart will indeed rejoice.

**¹⁶** My inmost being [^2502] will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.

## Saying 15

**¹⁷** Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.

**¹⁸** For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.

## Saying 16

**¹⁹** Listen, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right course.

**²⁰** Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat.

**²¹** For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.

## Saying 17

**²²** Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.

**²³** Invest in truth and never sell it— in wisdom and instruction and understanding.

**²⁴** The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.

**²⁵** May your father and mother be glad, and may she who gave you birth rejoice!

## Saying 18

**²⁶** My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways.

**²⁷** For a prostitute is a deep pit, and an adulteress [^2503] is a narrow well.

**²⁸** Like a robber she lies in wait and multiplies the faithless among men.

## Saying 19

**²⁹** Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has needless wounds? Who has bloodshot eyes?

**³⁰** Those who linger over wine, who go to taste mixed drinks.

**³¹** Do not gaze at wine while it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.

**³²** In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.

**³³** Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will utter perversities.

**³⁴** You will be like one sleeping on the high seas or lying on the top of a mast:

**³⁵** “They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I did not know it! When can I wake up to search for another drink?”

[^2499]: 23:1 Or who is before you
[^2500]: 23:6 Literally of him whose eye is evil
[^2501]: 23:7 Or for as he calculates in his soul, so is he
[^2502]: 23:16 Hebrew My kidneys
[^2503]: 23:27 Or a foreign woman or a wayward wife
