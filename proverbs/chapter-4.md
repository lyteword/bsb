# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding. 

<sup>2</sup> For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive. 

<sup>3</sup> When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother, 

<sup>4</sup> he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live. 

<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them. 

<sup>6</sup> Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you. 

<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire, gain understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you. 

<sup>9</sup> She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.” 

<sup>10</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many. 

<sup>11</sup> I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths. 

<sup>12</sup> When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble. 

<sup>13</sup> Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life. 

<sup>14</sup> Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers. 

<sup>15</sup> Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by. 

<sup>16</sup> For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall. 

<sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 

<sup>18</sup> The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday. 

<sup>19</sup> But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart. 

<sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body. 

<sup>23</sup> Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life. 

<sup>24</sup> Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech. 

<sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead. 

<sup>26</sup> Make a level path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure. 

<sup>27</sup> Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.
