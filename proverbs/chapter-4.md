# Chapter 4

## A Father’s Instruction

**¹** Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.

**²** For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive.

**³** When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother,

**⁴** he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live.

**⁵** Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them.

**⁶** Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you.

**⁷** Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire,[^2451] gain understanding.

**⁸** Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.

**⁹** She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.”

**¹⁰** Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.

**¹¹** I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths.

**¹²** When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble.

**¹³** Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life.

**¹⁴** Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.

**¹⁵** Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by.

**¹⁶** For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.

**¹⁷** For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

**¹⁸** The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.

**¹⁹** But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble.

**²⁰** My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.

**²¹** Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.

**²²** For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body.

**²³** Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.

**²⁴** Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech.

**²⁵** Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.

**²⁶** Make a level path for your feet,[^2452] and all your ways will be sure.

**²⁷** Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.

[^2451]: 4:7 Or And whatever else you acquire
[^2452]: 4:26 Or Ponder the path for your feet; LXX Make straight paths for your feet; cited in Hebrews 12:13
