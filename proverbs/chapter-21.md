## The King’s Heart

**(Psalms 21:1–13)**

<sup>1</sup> The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it where He pleases.

<sup>2</sup> All a man’s ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.

<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice is more desirable to the LORD than sacrifice.

<sup>4</sup> Haughty eyes and a proud heart— the guides of the wicked—are sin.

<sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent bring plenty, as surely as haste leads to poverty.

<sup>6</sup> Making a fortune by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist, a deadly pursuit.

<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will sweep them away because they refuse to do what is just.

<sup>8</sup> The way of a guilty man is crooked, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.

<sup>9</sup> Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked man craves evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.

<sup>11</sup> When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; and when a wise man is instructed, he acquires knowledge.

<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One [^2493] considers the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.

<sup>13</sup> Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too shall cry out and receive no answer.

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret soothes anger, and a covert bribe [^2494] pacifies great wrath.

<sup>15</sup> Justice executed is a joy to the righteous, but a terror to the workers of iniquity.

<sup>16</sup> The man who strays from the path of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.

<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure will become poor; the one who loves wine and oil will never be rich.

<sup>18</sup> The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.

<sup>19</sup> Better to live in the desert than with a contentious and ill-tempered wife.

<sup>20</sup> Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man consumes them.

<sup>21</sup> He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion finds life, righteousness, and honor.

<sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.

<sup>23</sup> He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.

<sup>24</sup> Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man— of him who acts with excessive pride.

<sup>25</sup> The craving of the slacker kills him because his hands refuse to work.

<sup>26</sup> All day long he covets more, but the righteous give without restraint.

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable— how much more so when brought with ill intent!

<sup>28</sup> A lying witness will perish, but the man who listens to truth will speak forever.

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face,[^2495] but the upright man makes his way sure.

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.

<sup>31</sup> A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.
