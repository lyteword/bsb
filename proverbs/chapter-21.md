# Chapter 21

## The King’s Heart

**(Psalms 21:1–13)**

**¹** The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it where He pleases.

**²** All a man’s ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.

**³** To do righteousness and justice is more desirable to the LORD than sacrifice.

**⁴** Haughty eyes and a proud heart— the guides of the wicked—are sin.

**⁵** The plans of the diligent bring plenty, as surely as haste leads to poverty.

**⁶** Making a fortune by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist, a deadly pursuit.

**⁷** The violence of the wicked will sweep them away because they refuse to do what is just.

**⁸** The way of a guilty man is crooked, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.

**⁹** Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked man craves evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.

**¹¹** When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; and when a wise man is instructed, he acquires knowledge.

**¹²** The Righteous One [^2493] considers the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.

**¹³** Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too shall cry out and receive no answer.

**¹⁴** A gift in secret soothes anger, and a covert bribe [^2494] pacifies great wrath.

**¹⁵** Justice executed is a joy to the righteous, but a terror to the workers of iniquity.

**¹⁶** The man who strays from the path of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.

**¹⁷** He who loves pleasure will become poor; the one who loves wine and oil will never be rich.

**¹⁸** The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.

**¹⁹** Better to live in the desert than with a contentious and ill-tempered wife.

**²⁰** Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man consumes them.

**²¹** He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion finds life, righteousness, and honor.

**²²** A wise man scales the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.

**²³** He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.

**²⁴** Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man— of him who acts with excessive pride.

**²⁵** The craving of the slacker kills him because his hands refuse to work.

**²⁶** All day long he covets more, but the righteous give without restraint.

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable— how much more so when brought with ill intent!

**²⁸** A lying witness will perish, but the man who listens to truth will speak forever.

**²⁹** A wicked man hardens his face,[^2495] but the upright man makes his way sure.

**³⁰** There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.

**³¹** A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.
