# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 

<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city. 

<sup>4</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment. 

<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed. 

<sup>6</sup> Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.” 

<sup>7</sup> He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself. 

<sup>8</sup> Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. 

<sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. 

<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences. 

<sup>13</sup> The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing. 

<sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city, 

<sup>15</sup> calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight. 

<sup>16</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment. 

<sup>17</sup> “Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!” 

<sup>18</sup> But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
