# Chapter 9

## The Way of Wisdom

**(Proverbs 1:1–7)**

**¹** Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out [^2470] her seven pillars.

**²** She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

**³** She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city.

**⁴** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.

**⁵** “Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed.

**⁶** Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.”

**⁷** He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself.

**⁸** Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.

**⁹** Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.

**¹⁰** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

**¹¹** For through wisdom [^2471] your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.

**¹²** If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.

## The Way of Folly

**¹³** The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.

**¹⁴** She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,

**¹⁵** calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight.

**¹⁶** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.

**¹⁷** “Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!”

**¹⁸** But they do not know that the dead [^2472] are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
