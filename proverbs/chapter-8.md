# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice? 

<sup>2</sup> On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 

<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out: 

<sup>4</sup> “To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding. 

<sup>6</sup> Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right. 

<sup>7</sup> For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse. 

<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold. 

<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her. 

<sup>12</sup> I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech. 

<sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight and strength. 

<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws; 

<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule, and all nobles who govern justly. 

<sup>17</sup> I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me. 

<sup>18</sup> With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice, 

<sup>21</sup> bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full. 

<sup>22</sup> The LORD created me as His first course, before His works of old. 

<sup>23</sup> From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began. 

<sup>24</sup> When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, when no springs were overflowing with water. 

<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth, 

<sup>26</sup> before He made the land or fields, or any of the dust of the earth. 

<sup>27</sup> I was there when He established the heavens, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep, 

<sup>28</sup> when He established the clouds above, when the fountains of the deep gushed forth, 

<sup>29</sup> when He set a boundary for the sea, so that the waters would not surpass His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth. 

<sup>30</sup> Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, and His delight day by day, rejoicing always in His presence. 

<sup>31</sup> I was rejoicing in His whole world, delighting together in the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> Listen to instruction and be wise; do not ignore it. 

<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my doorway. 

<sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD. 

<sup>36</sup> But he who fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”
