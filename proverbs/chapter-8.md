# Chapter 8

## The Excellence of Wisdom

**¹** Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?

**²** On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.

**³** Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:

**⁴** “To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men.

**⁵** O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding.[^2466]

**⁶** Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right.

**⁷** For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.

**⁸** All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse.

**⁹** They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge.

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.

**¹¹** For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.

**¹²** I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.

**¹³** To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.

**¹⁴** Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight and strength.

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws;

**¹⁶** By me princes rule, and all nobles who govern justly.[^2467]

**¹⁷** I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.

**¹⁸** With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and righteousness.

**¹⁹** My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver.

**²⁰** I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,

**²¹** bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.

**²²** The LORD created me as His first course,[^2468] before His works of old.

**²³** From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began.

**²⁴** When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, when no springs were overflowing with water.

**²⁵** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth,

**²⁶** before He made the land or fields, or any of the dust of the earth.

**²⁷** I was there when He established the heavens, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,

**²⁸** when He established the clouds above, when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,

**²⁹** when He set a boundary for the sea, so that the waters would not surpass His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth.

**³⁰** Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, and His delight [^2469] day by day, rejoicing always in His presence.

**³¹** I was rejoicing in His whole world, delighting together in the sons of men.

**³²** Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.

**³³** Listen to instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.

**³⁴** Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my doorway.

**³⁵** For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD.

**³⁶** But he who fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”
