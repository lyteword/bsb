## The Benefits of Wisdom

**¹** My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,

**²** if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,

**³** if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,

**⁴** if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,

**⁵** then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.

**⁶** For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

**⁷** He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,

**⁸** to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.

**⁹** Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equity—every good path.

**¹⁰** For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.

**¹¹** Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,

**¹²** to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,

**¹³** from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,

**¹⁴** from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,

**¹⁵** whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.

**¹⁶** It will rescue you from the forbidden woman,[^2441] from the stranger [^2442] with seductive words

**¹⁷** who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.

**¹⁸** For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.[^2443]

**¹⁹** None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.

**²⁰** So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.

**²¹** For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;

**²²** but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
