## The Benefits of Wisdom

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,

<sup>2</sup> if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,

<sup>3</sup> if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,

<sup>4</sup> if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,

<sup>5</sup> then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

<sup>7</sup> He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,

<sup>8</sup> to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.

<sup>9</sup> Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equity—every good path.

<sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.

<sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,

<sup>12</sup> to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,

<sup>13</sup> from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,

<sup>14</sup> from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,

<sup>15</sup> whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.

<sup>16</sup> It will rescue you from the forbidden woman,[^2441] from the stranger [^2442] with seductive words

<sup>17</sup> who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.

<sup>18</sup> For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.[^2443]

<sup>19</sup> None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.

<sup>20</sup> So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.

<sup>21</sup> For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;

<sup>22</sup> but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
