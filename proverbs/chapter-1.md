# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel, 

<sup>2</sup> for gaining wisdom and discipline, for comprehending words of insight, 

<sup>3</sup> and for receiving instruction in wise living and in righteousness, justice, and equity. 

<sup>4</sup> To impart prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the young, 

<sup>5</sup> let the wise listen and gain instruction, and the discerning acquire wise counsel 

<sup>6</sup> by understanding the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. 

<sup>7</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. 

<sup>8</sup> Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother. 

<sup>9</sup> For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck. 

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them. 

<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause, 

<sup>12</sup> let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit. 

<sup>13</sup> We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder. 

<sup>14</sup> Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”— 

<sup>15</sup> my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path. 

<sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood. 

<sup>17</sup> How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it! 

<sup>18</sup> But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives. 

<sup>19</sup> Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors. 

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square; 

<sup>21</sup> in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech: 

<sup>22</sup> “How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge? 

<sup>23</sup> If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you. 

<sup>24</sup> Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand, 

<sup>25</sup> because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction, 

<sup>26</sup> in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you, 

<sup>27</sup> when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me. 

<sup>29</sup> For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD. 

<sup>30</sup> They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof. 

<sup>31</sup> So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 

<sup>32</sup> For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. 

<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”
