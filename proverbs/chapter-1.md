# Chapter 1

## The Beginning of Knowledge

**(Proverbs 9:1–12)**

**¹** These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel,

**²** for gaining wisdom and discipline, for comprehending words of insight,

**³** and for receiving instruction in wise living and in righteousness, justice, and equity.

**⁴** To impart prudence to the simple [^2438] and knowledge and discretion to the young,

**⁵** let the wise listen and gain instruction, and the discerning acquire wise counsel

**⁶** by understanding the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

**⁷** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools [^2439] despise wisdom and discipline.

## The Enticement of Sin

**⁸** Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.

**⁹** For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck.

**¹⁰** My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them.

**¹¹** If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause,

**¹²** let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.

**¹³** We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder.

**¹⁴** Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—

**¹⁵** my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.

**¹⁶** For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood.

**¹⁷** How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it!

**¹⁸** But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.

**¹⁹** Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.

## Wisdom Calls Aloud

**²⁰** Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;

**²¹** in the main concourse [^2440] she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:

**²²** “How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?

**²³** If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.

**²⁴** Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,

**²⁵** because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,

**²⁶** in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,

**²⁷** when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.

**²⁸** Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.

**²⁹** For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.

**³⁰** They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.

**³¹** So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

**³²** For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.

**³³** But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”

[^2438]: 1:4 The Hebrew word rendered simple in Proverbs refers to one who is naive, without moral direction, or inclined to evil.
[^2439]: 1:7 The Hebrew words rendered as fool in Proverbs denote one who is morally deficient.
[^2440]: 1:21 Or from the top of the wall
