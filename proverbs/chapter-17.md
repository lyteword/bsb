# Chapter 17

## Better a Dry Morsel in Quietness

**¹** Better a dry morsel in quietness than a house full of feasting [^2484] with strife.

**²** A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.

**³** A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but the LORD is the tester of hearts.

**⁴** A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.

**⁵** He who mocks the poor insults their Maker; whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.

**⁶** Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of a son is his father.

**⁷** Eloquent words are unfit for a fool; how much worse are lying lips to a ruler!

**⁸** A bribe is a charm to its giver; wherever he turns, he succeeds.

**⁹** Whoever conceals an offense promotes love, but he who brings it up separates friends.

**¹⁰** A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment deeper than a hundred lashes cut into a fool.

**¹¹** An evil man seeks only rebellion; a cruel messenger will be sent against him.

**¹²** It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly.

**¹³** If anyone returns evil for good, evil will never leave his house.

**¹⁴** To start a quarrel is to release a flood; so abandon the dispute before it breaks out.

**¹⁵** Acquitting the guilty and condemning the righteous— both are detestable to the LORD.

**¹⁶** Why should the fool have money in his hand with no intention of buying wisdom?

**¹⁷** A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

**¹⁸** A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor.

**¹⁹** He who loves transgression loves strife; he who builds his gate high invites destruction.

**²⁰** The one with a perverse heart finds no good, and he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble.

**²¹** A man fathers a fool to his own grief; the father of a fool has no joy.

**²²** A joyful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.

**²³** A wicked man takes a covert bribe [^2485] to subvert the course of justice.

**²⁴** Wisdom is the focus of the discerning, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.

**²⁵** A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.

**²⁶** It is surely not good to punish the innocent or to flog a noble for his honesty.

**²⁷** A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a man of understanding maintains a calm spirit.

**²⁸** Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent, and discerning when he holds his tongue.

[^2484]: 17:1 Or sacrifices
