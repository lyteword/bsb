## Better a Dry Morsel in Quietness

<sup>1</sup> Better a dry morsel in quietness than a house full of feasting [^2484] with strife.

<sup>2</sup> A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.

<sup>3</sup> A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but the LORD is the tester of hearts.

<sup>4</sup> A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.

<sup>5</sup> He who mocks the poor insults their Maker; whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.

<sup>6</sup> Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of a son is his father.

<sup>7</sup> Eloquent words are unfit for a fool; how much worse are lying lips to a ruler!

<sup>8</sup> A bribe is a charm to its giver; wherever he turns, he succeeds.

<sup>9</sup> Whoever conceals an offense promotes love, but he who brings it up separates friends.

<sup>10</sup> A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment deeper than a hundred lashes cut into a fool.

<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeks only rebellion; a cruel messenger will be sent against him.

<sup>12</sup> It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly.

<sup>13</sup> If anyone returns evil for good, evil will never leave his house.

<sup>14</sup> To start a quarrel is to release a flood; so abandon the dispute before it breaks out.

<sup>15</sup> Acquitting the guilty and condemning the righteous— both are detestable to the LORD.

<sup>16</sup> Why should the fool have money in his hand with no intention of buying wisdom?

<sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

<sup>18</sup> A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor.

<sup>19</sup> He who loves transgression loves strife; he who builds his gate high invites destruction.

<sup>20</sup> The one with a perverse heart finds no good, and he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble.

<sup>21</sup> A man fathers a fool to his own grief; the father of a fool has no joy.

<sup>22</sup> A joyful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.

<sup>23</sup> A wicked man takes a covert bribe [^2485] to subvert the course of justice.

<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is the focus of the discerning, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.

<sup>25</sup> A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.

<sup>26</sup> It is surely not good to punish the innocent or to flog a noble for his honesty.

<sup>27</sup> A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a man of understanding maintains a calm spirit.

<sup>28</sup> Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent, and discerning when he holds his tongue.
