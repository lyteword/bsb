## Warnings against Foolishness

**¹** My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,

**²** if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,

**³** then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself,[^2459] and press your plea with your neighbor.

**⁴** Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.

**⁵** Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,[^2460] like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

**⁶** Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.

**⁷** Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,

**⁸** it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.

**⁹** How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?

**¹⁰** A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,

**¹¹** and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.

**¹²** A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,

**¹³** winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.

**¹⁴** With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.

**¹⁵** Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.

**¹⁶** There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:

**¹⁷** haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,

**¹⁸** a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,

**¹⁹** a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.

## Warnings against Adultery

**²⁰** My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.

**²¹** Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.

**²²** When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.

**²³** For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,

**²⁴** to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.[^2461]

**²⁵** Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.[^2462]

**²⁶** For the levy of the prostitute is poverty,[^2463] and the adulteress preys upon your very life.

**²⁷** Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?

**²⁸** Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?

**²⁹** So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.

**³⁰** Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.

**³¹** Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.

**³²** He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.

**³³** Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.

**³⁴** For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.

**³⁵** He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.
