# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger, 

<sup>2</sup> if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth, 

<sup>3</sup> then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor. 

<sup>4</sup> Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 

<sup>5</sup> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. 

<sup>6</sup> Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise. 

<sup>7</sup> Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest. 

<sup>9</sup> How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, 

<sup>11</sup> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit. 

<sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth, 

<sup>13</sup> winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers. 

<sup>14</sup> With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery. 

<sup>16</sup> There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him: 

<sup>17</sup> haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, 

<sup>18</sup> a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil, 

<sup>19</sup> a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers. 

<sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. 

<sup>21</sup> Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck. 

<sup>22</sup> When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you. 

<sup>23</sup> For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life, 

<sup>24</sup> to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress. 

<sup>25</sup> Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes. 

<sup>26</sup> For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life. 

<sup>27</sup> Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned? 

<sup>28</sup> Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet? 

<sup>29</sup> So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished. 

<sup>30</sup> Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger. 

<sup>31</sup> Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house. 

<sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself. 

<sup>33</sup> Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away. 

<sup>34</sup> For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance. 

<sup>35</sup> He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.
