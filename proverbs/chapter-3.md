# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments; 

<sup>2</sup> for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life. 

<sup>3</sup> Never let loving devotion or faithfulness leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man. 

<sup>5</sup> Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; 

<sup>6</sup> in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 

<sup>8</sup> This will bring healing to your body and refreshment to your bones. 

<sup>9</sup> Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest; 

<sup>10</sup> then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke; 

<sup>12</sup> for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights. 

<sup>13</sup> Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who acquires understanding, 

<sup>14</sup> for she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold. 

<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her. 

<sup>16</sup> Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 

<sup>17</sup> All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful. 

<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who lay hold of her are blessed. 

<sup>19</sup> The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding. 

<sup>20</sup> By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open, and the clouds dripped with dew. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, do not lose sight of this: Preserve sound judgment and discernment. 

<sup>22</sup> They will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck. 

<sup>23</sup> Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble. 

<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet. 

<sup>25</sup> Do not fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked, 

<sup>26</sup> for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from the snare. 

<sup>27</sup> Do not withhold good from the deserving when it is within your power to act. 

<sup>28</sup> Do not tell your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I will provide”— when you already have the means. 

<sup>29</sup> Do not devise evil against your neighbor, for he trustfully dwells beside you. 

<sup>30</sup> Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm. 

<sup>31</sup> Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways; 

<sup>32</sup> for the LORD detests the perverse, but He is a friend to the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous. 

<sup>34</sup> He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble. 

<sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit honor, but fools are held up to shame.
