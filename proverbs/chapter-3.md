# Chapter 3

## Trust in the LORD with All Your Heart

**¹** My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;

**²** for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life.

**³** Never let loving devotion [^2444] or faithfulness leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.

**⁴** Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.

**⁵** Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;

**⁶** in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.

**⁷** Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.

**⁸** This will bring healing to your body [^2445] and refreshment [^2446] to your bones.

**⁹** Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your crops;

**¹⁰** then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.

**¹¹** My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke;[^2447]

**¹²** for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights.[^2448]

## The Blessings of Wisdom

**¹³** Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who acquires understanding,

**¹⁴** for she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold.

**¹⁵** She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her.

**¹⁶** Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.

**¹⁷** All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.

**¹⁸** She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who lay hold of her are blessed.

**¹⁹** The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.

**²⁰** By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open, and the clouds dripped with dew.

**²¹** My son, do not lose sight of this: Preserve sound judgment and discernment.

**²²** They will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.

**²³** Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.

**²⁴** When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.

**²⁵** Do not fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked,

**²⁶** for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from the snare.

**²⁷** Do not withhold good from the deserving [^2449] when it is within your power to act.

**²⁸** Do not tell your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I will provide”— when you already have the means.

**²⁹** Do not devise evil against your neighbor, for he trustfully dwells beside you.

**³⁰** Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm.

**³¹** Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;

**³²** for the LORD detests the perverse, but He is a friend to the upright.

**³³** The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.

**³⁴** He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.[^2450]

**³⁵** The wise will inherit honor, but fools are held up to shame.
