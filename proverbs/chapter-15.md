# Chapter 15

## A Gentle Answer Turns Away Wrath

**¹** A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

**²** The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth of the fool spouts folly.

**³** The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good.

**⁴** A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit.

**⁵** A fool rejects his father’s discipline, but whoever heeds correction is prudent.

**⁶** The house of the righteous has great treasure, but the income of the wicked is trouble.

**⁷** The lips of the wise spread knowledge, but not so the hearts of fools.

**⁸** The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to the LORD, but the prayer of the upright is His delight.

**⁹** The LORD detests the way of the wicked, but He loves those who pursue righteousness.

**¹⁰** Discipline is harsh for him who leaves the path; he who hates correction will die.

**¹¹** Sheol and Abaddon [^2481] lie open before the LORD— how much more the hearts of men!

**¹²** A mocker does not love to be reproved, nor will he consult the wise.

**¹³** A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance, but sorrow of the heart crushes the spirit.

**¹⁴** A discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.

**¹⁵** All the days of the oppressed are bad, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.

**¹⁶** Better a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure with turmoil.

**¹⁷** Better a dish of vegetables where there is love than a fattened ox with hatred.

**¹⁸** A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger calms dispute.

**¹⁹** The way of the slacker is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway.

**²⁰** A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish man despises his mother.

**²¹** Folly is joy to one who lacks judgment, but a man of understanding walks a straight path.

**²²** Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.

**²³** A man takes joy in a fitting reply— and how good is a timely word!

**²⁴** The path of life leads upward for the wise, that he may avoid going down to Sheol.

**²⁵** The LORD tears down the house of the proud, but He protects the boundaries of the widow.

**²⁶** The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the words of the pure are pleasant to Him.

**²⁷** He who is greedy for unjust gain brings trouble on his household, but he who hates bribes will live.

**²⁸** The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked blurts out evil.

**²⁹** The LORD is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.

**³⁰** The light of the eyes cheers the heart, and good news nourishes the bones.

**³¹** He who listens to life-giving reproof will dwell among the wise.

**³²** He who ignores discipline despises himself, but whoever heeds correction gains understanding.

**³³** The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor.
