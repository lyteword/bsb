# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. 

<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth of the fool spouts folly. 

<sup>3</sup> The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good. 

<sup>4</sup> A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> A fool rejects his father’s discipline, but whoever heeds correction is prudent. 

<sup>6</sup> The house of the righteous has great treasure, but the income of the wicked is trouble. 

<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise spread knowledge, but not so the hearts of fools. 

<sup>8</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to the LORD, but the prayer of the upright is His delight. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD detests the way of the wicked, but He loves those who pursue righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> Discipline is harsh for him who leaves the path; he who hates correction will die. 

<sup>11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the LORD— how much more the hearts of men! 

<sup>12</sup> A mocker does not love to be reproved, nor will he consult the wise. 

<sup>13</sup> A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance, but sorrow of the heart crushes the spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> A discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly. 

<sup>15</sup> All the days of the oppressed are bad, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast. 

<sup>16</sup> Better a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure with turmoil. 

<sup>17</sup> Better a dish of vegetables where there is love than a fattened ox with hatred. 

<sup>18</sup> A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger calms dispute. 

<sup>19</sup> The way of the slacker is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway. 

<sup>20</sup> A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish man despises his mother. 

<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one who lacks judgment, but a man of understanding walks a straight path. 

<sup>22</sup> Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed. 

<sup>23</sup> A man takes joy in a fitting reply— and how good is a timely word! 

<sup>24</sup> The path of life leads upward for the wise, that he may avoid going down to Sheol. 

<sup>25</sup> The LORD tears down the house of the proud, but He protects the boundaries of the widow. 

<sup>26</sup> The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the words of the pure are pleasant to Him. 

<sup>27</sup> He who is greedy for unjust gain brings trouble on his household, but he who hates bribes will live. 

<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked blurts out evil. 

<sup>29</sup> The LORD is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous. 

<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes cheers the heart, and good news nourishes the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> He who listens to life-giving reproof will dwell among the wise. 

<sup>32</sup> He who ignores discipline despises himself, but whoever heeds correction gains understanding. 

<sup>33</sup> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor.
