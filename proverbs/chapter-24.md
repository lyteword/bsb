# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Do not envy wicked men or desire their company; 

<sup>2</sup> for their hearts devise violence, and their lips declare trouble. 

<sup>3</sup> By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established; 

<sup>4</sup> through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure. 

<sup>5</sup> A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge enhances his strength. 

<sup>6</sup> Only with sound guidance should you wage war, and victory lies in a multitude of counselors. 

<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the meeting place. 

<sup>8</sup> He who plots evil will be called a schemer. 

<sup>9</sup> A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to men. 

<sup>10</sup> If you faint in the day of distress, how small is your strength! 

<sup>11</sup> Rescue those being led away to death, and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter. 

<sup>12</sup> If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” does not He who weighs hearts consider it? Does not the One who guards your life know? Will He not repay a man according to his deeds? 

<sup>13</sup> Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste. 

<sup>14</sup> Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there is a future for you, and your hope will never be cut off. 

<sup>15</sup> Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place. 

<sup>16</sup> For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; but the wicked stumble in bad times. 

<sup>17</sup> Do not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles, 

<sup>18</sup> or the LORD will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from him. 

<sup>19</sup> Do not fret over evildoers, and do not be envious of the wicked. 

<sup>20</sup> For the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished. 

<sup>21</sup> My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not associate with the rebellious. 

<sup>22</sup> For they will bring sudden destruction. Who knows what ruin they can bring? 

<sup>23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good. 

<sup>24</sup> Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”— peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him; 

<sup>25</sup> but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. 

<sup>26</sup> An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips. 

<sup>27</sup> Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; after that, you may build your house. 

<sup>28</sup> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips. 

<sup>29</sup> Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his work.” 

<sup>30</sup> I went past the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment. 

<sup>31</sup> Thorns had grown up everywhere, thistles had covered the ground, and the stone wall was broken down. 

<sup>32</sup> I observed and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction: 

<sup>33</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, 

<sup>34</sup> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
