## Do Not Envy

## Saying 20

**¹** Do not envy wicked men or desire their company;

**²** for their hearts devise violence, and their lips declare trouble.

## Saying 21

**³** By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established;

**⁴** through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.

## Saying 22

**⁵** A wise man is strong,[^2504] and a man of knowledge enhances his strength.

**⁶** Only with sound guidance should you wage war, and victory lies in a multitude of counselors.

## Saying 23

**⁷** Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.

## Saying 24

**⁸** He who plots evil will be called a schemer.

**⁹** A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to men.

## Saying 25

**¹⁰** If you faint in the day of distress, how small is your strength!

**¹¹** Rescue those being led away to death, and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter.

**¹²** If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” does not He who weighs hearts consider it? Does not the One who guards your life know? Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?

## Saying 26

**¹³** Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.

**¹⁴** Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there is a future for you, and your hope will never be cut off.

## Saying 27

**¹⁵** Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place.

**¹⁶** For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; but the wicked stumble in bad times.

## Saying 28

**¹⁷** Do not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,

**¹⁸** or the LORD will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from him.

## Saying 29

**¹⁹** Do not fret over evildoers, and do not be envious of the wicked.

**²⁰** For the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.

## Saying 30

**²¹** My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not associate with the rebellious.

**²²** For they will bring sudden destruction. Who knows what ruin they can bring?

## Further Sayings of the Wise

**²³** These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.

**²⁴** Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”— peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him;

**²⁵** but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.

**²⁶** An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips.

**²⁷** Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; after that, you may build your house.

**²⁸** Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.

**²⁹** Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his work.”

**³⁰** I went past the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.

**³¹** Thorns had grown up everywhere, thistles had covered the ground, and the stone wall was broken down.

**³²** I observed and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction:

**³³** A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,

**³⁴** and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
