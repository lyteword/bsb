# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but an accurate weight is His delight. 

<sup>2</sup> When pride comes, disgrace follows, but with humility comes wisdom. 

<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright guides them, but the perversity of the faithless destroys them. 

<sup>4</sup> Riches are worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness brings deliverance from death. 

<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the blameless directs their path, but the wicked fall by their own wickedness. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the faithless are trapped by their own desires. 

<sup>7</sup> When the wicked man dies, his hope perishes, and the hope of his strength vanishes. 

<sup>8</sup> The righteous man is delivered from trouble; in his place the wicked man goes in. 

<sup>9</sup> With his mouth the ungodly man destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous are rescued. 

<sup>10</sup> When the righteous thrive, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy. 

<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright a city is built up, but by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down. 

<sup>12</sup> Whoever shows contempt for his neighbor lacks judgment, but a man of understanding remains silent. 

<sup>13</sup> A gossip reveals a secret, but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence. 

<sup>14</sup> For lack of guidance, a nation falls, but with many counselors comes deliverance. 

<sup>15</sup> He who puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer, but the one who hates indebtedness is secure. 

<sup>16</sup> A gracious woman attains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth. 

<sup>17</sup> A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked man earns an empty wage, but he who sows righteousness reaps a true reward. 

<sup>19</sup> Genuine righteousness leads to life, but the pursuit of evil brings death. 

<sup>20</sup> The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, but the blameless in their walk are His delight. 

<sup>21</sup> Be assured that the wicked will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will escape. 

<sup>22</sup> Like a gold ring in a pigâ€™s snout is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. 

<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous leads only to good, but the hope of the wicked brings wrath. 

<sup>24</sup> One gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor. 

<sup>25</sup> A generous soul will prosper, and he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed. 

<sup>26</sup> The people will curse the hoarder of grain, but blessing will crown the one who sells it. 

<sup>27</sup> He who searches out good finds favor, but evil will come to him who seeks it. 

<sup>28</sup> He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like foliage. 

<sup>29</sup> He who brings trouble on his house will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart. 

<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise. 

<sup>31</sup> If the righteous receive their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner!
