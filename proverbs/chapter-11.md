## Dishonest Scales

**(Deuteronomy 25:13–16; Ezekiel 45:10–12)**

**¹** Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but an accurate weight is His delight.

**²** When pride comes, disgrace follows, but with humility comes wisdom.

**³** The integrity of the upright guides them, but the perversity of the faithless destroys them.

**⁴** Riches are worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness brings deliverance from death.

**⁵** The righteousness of the blameless directs their path, but the wicked fall by their own wickedness.

**⁶** The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the faithless are trapped by their own desires.

**⁷** When the wicked man dies, his hope perishes, and the hope of his strength vanishes.

**⁸** The righteous man is delivered from trouble; in his place the wicked man goes in.

**⁹** With his mouth the ungodly man destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous are rescued.

**¹⁰** When the righteous thrive, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.

**¹¹** By the blessing of the upright a city is built up, but by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.

**¹²** Whoever shows contempt for his neighbor lacks judgment, but a man of understanding remains silent.

**¹³** A gossip reveals a secret, but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.

**¹⁴** For lack of guidance, a nation falls, but with many counselors comes deliverance.

**¹⁵** He who puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer, but the one who hates indebtedness is secure.

**¹⁶** A gracious woman attains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth.

**¹⁷** A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.

**¹⁸** The wicked man earns an empty wage, but he who sows righteousness reaps a true reward.

**¹⁹** Genuine righteousness leads to life, but the pursuit of evil brings death.

**²⁰** The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, but the blameless in their walk are His delight.

**²¹** Be assured that the wicked will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will escape.

**²²** Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.

**²³** The desire of the righteous leads only to good, but the hope of the wicked brings wrath.

**²⁴** One gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor.

**²⁵** A generous soul will prosper, and he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.

**²⁶** The people will curse the hoarder of grain, but blessing will crown the one who sells it.

**²⁷** He who searches out good finds favor, but evil will come to him who seeks it.

**²⁸** He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like foliage.

**²⁹** He who brings trouble on his house will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.

**³⁰** The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise.

**³¹** If the righteous receive their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner![^2476]

[^2476]: 11:31 LXX If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner? Cited in 1 Peter 4:18
