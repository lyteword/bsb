## Do Not Boast about Tomorrow

**(James 4:13–17)**

<sup>1</sup> Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.

<sup>2</sup> Let another praise you, and not your own mouth— a stranger, and not your own lips.

<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.

<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?

<sup>5</sup> Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.

<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

<sup>7</sup> The soul that is full loathes honey, but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.

<sup>8</sup> Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who wanders from his home.

<sup>9</sup> Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the counsel of a friend is sweetness to the soul.

<sup>10</sup> Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.

<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, so that I can answer him who taunts me.

<sup>12</sup> The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.

<sup>13</sup> Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.[^2510]

<sup>14</sup> If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted to him as a curse.

<sup>15</sup> A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—

<sup>16</sup> restraining her is like holding back the wind or grasping oil with one’s right hand.

<sup>17</sup> As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.[^2511]

<sup>18</sup> Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.

<sup>19</sup> As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the true man.

<sup>20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon [^2512] are never satisfied; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

<sup>21</sup> A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.

<sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, yet his folly will not depart from him.

<sup>23</sup> Be sure to know the state of your flocks, and pay close attention to your herds;

<sup>24</sup> for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to every generation.

<sup>25</sup> When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered,

<sup>26</sup> the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.

<sup>27</sup> You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you— food for your household and nourishment for your maidservants.

[^2510]: 27:13 Or a wayward woman
[^2511]: 27:17 Hebrew sharpens the face of another or sharpens the countenance of a friend
[^2512]: 27:20 Or Death and Destruction
