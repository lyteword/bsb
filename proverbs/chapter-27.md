## Do Not Boast about Tomorrow

**(James 4:13–17)**

**¹** Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.

**²** Let another praise you, and not your own mouth— a stranger, and not your own lips.

**³** A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.

**⁴** Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?

**⁵** Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.

**⁶** The wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

**⁷** The soul that is full loathes honey, but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.

**⁸** Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who wanders from his home.

**⁹** Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the counsel of a friend is sweetness to the soul.

**¹⁰** Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.

**¹¹** Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, so that I can answer him who taunts me.

**¹²** The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.

**¹³** Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.[^2510]

**¹⁴** If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted to him as a curse.

**¹⁵** A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—

**¹⁶** restraining her is like holding back the wind or grasping oil with one’s right hand.

**¹⁷** As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.[^2511]

**¹⁸** Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.

**¹⁹** As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the true man.

**²⁰** Sheol and Abaddon [^2512] are never satisfied; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

**²¹** A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.

**²²** Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, yet his folly will not depart from him.

**²³** Be sure to know the state of your flocks, and pay close attention to your herds;

**²⁴** for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to every generation.

**²⁵** When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered,

**²⁶** the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.

**²⁷** You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you— food for your household and nourishment for your maidservants.

[^2510]: 27:13 Or a wayward woman
[^2511]: 27:17 Hebrew sharpens the face of another or sharpens the countenance of a friend
[^2512]: 27:20 Or Death and Destruction
