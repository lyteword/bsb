## More Proverbs of Solomon

**¹** These are additional proverbs of Solomon, which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:

**²** It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to search it out.

**³** As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings cannot be searched.

**⁴** Remove the dross from the silver, and a vessel for a silversmith will come forth.

**⁵** Remove the wicked from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness.

**⁶** Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of great men;

**⁷** for it is better to be told, “Come up here!” than to be demoted in the presence of the prince. Even what [^2505] you have seen with your own eyes,

**⁸** do not bring hastily to court. Otherwise, what will you do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame?

**⁹** Argue your case with your neighbor without betraying another’s confidence,

**¹⁰** lest he who hears you bring shame upon you, and your infamy never go away.

**¹¹** A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.

**¹²** Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man’s rebuke to a listening ear.

**¹³** Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters.

**¹⁴** Like clouds and wind without rain is the man who boasts of gifts never given.

**¹⁵** Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.

**¹⁶** If you find honey, eat just what you need, lest you have too much and vomit it up.

**¹⁷** Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house, lest he grow weary and hate you.

**¹⁸** Like a club or sword or sharp arrow is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor.

**¹⁹** Like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.

**²⁰** Like one who removes a garment on a cold day or vinegar poured on a wound [^2506] is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.

**²¹** If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.

**²²** For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head,[^2507] and the LORD will reward you.

**²³** As the north wind brings forth rain, so a backbiting tongue brings angry looks.

**²⁴** Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

**²⁵** Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.

**²⁶** Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked.

**²⁷** It is not good to eat too much honey or to search out one’s own glory.

**²⁸** Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who does not control his temper.

[^2505]: 25:7 Or Even the one
[^2506]: 25:20 Or on soda
[^2507]: 25:22 LXX; Hebrew For you will heap burning coals on his head; cited in Romans 12:20
