# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman builds her house, but a foolish one tears it down with her own hands. 

<sup>2</sup> He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD, but the one who is devious in his ways despises Him. 

<sup>3</sup> The proud speech of a fool brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them. 

<sup>4</sup> Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but an abundant harvest comes through the strength of the ox. 

<sup>5</sup> An honest witness does not deceive, but a dishonest witness pours forth lies. 

<sup>6</sup> A mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning. 

<sup>7</sup> Stay away from a foolish man; you will gain no knowledge from his speech. 

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way, but the folly of fools deceives them. 

<sup>9</sup> Fools mock the making of amends, but goodwill is found among the upright. 

<sup>10</sup> The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares in its joy. 

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish. 

<sup>12</sup> There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. 

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in sorrow. 

<sup>14</sup> The backslider in heart receives the fill of his own ways, but a good man is rewarded for his ways. 

<sup>15</sup> The simple man believes every word, but the prudent man watches his steps. 

<sup>16</sup> A wise man fears and turns from evil, but a fool is careless and reckless. 

<sup>17</sup> A quick-tempered man acts foolishly, and a devious man is hated. 

<sup>18</sup> The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

<sup>19</sup> The evil bow before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

<sup>20</sup> The poor man is hated even by his neighbor, but many are those who love the rich. 

<sup>21</sup> He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who shows kindness to the poor. 

<sup>22</sup> Do not those who contrive evil go astray? But those who plan goodness find loving devotion and faithfulness. 

<sup>23</sup> There is profit in all labor, but mere talk leads only to poverty. 

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their wealth, but the effort of fools is folly. 

<sup>25</sup> A truthful witness saves lives, but one who utters lies is deceitful. 

<sup>26</sup> He who fears the LORD is secure in confidence, and his children shall have a place of refuge. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death. 

<sup>28</sup> A large population is a king’s splendor, but a lack of subjects is a prince’s ruin. 

<sup>29</sup> A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man promotes folly. 

<sup>30</sup> A tranquil heart is life to the body, but envy rots the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor taunts their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors Him. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked man is thrown down by his own sin, but the righteous man has a refuge even in death. 

<sup>33</sup> Wisdom rests in the heart of the discerning; even among fools she is known. 

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people. 

<sup>35</sup> A king delights in a wise servant, but his anger falls on the shameful.
