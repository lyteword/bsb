# Chapter 14

## The Wise Woman

**¹** Every wise woman builds her house, but a foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

**²** He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD, but the one who is devious in his ways despises Him.

**³** The proud speech of a fool brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them.

**⁴** Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but an abundant harvest comes through the strength of the ox.

**⁵** An honest witness does not deceive, but a dishonest witness pours forth lies.

**⁶** A mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.

**⁷** Stay away from a foolish man; you will gain no knowledge from his speech.

**⁸** The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way, but the folly of fools deceives them.

**⁹** Fools mock the making of amends, but goodwill is found among the upright.

**¹⁰** The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares in its joy.

**¹¹** The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.

**¹²** There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

**¹³** Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in sorrow.

**¹⁴** The backslider in heart receives the fill of his own ways, but a good man is rewarded for his ways.

**¹⁵** The simple man believes every word, but the prudent man watches his steps.

**¹⁶** A wise man fears [^2478] and turns from evil, but a fool is careless and reckless.

**¹⁷** A quick-tempered man acts foolishly, and a devious man is hated.

**¹⁸** The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

**¹⁹** The evil bow before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

**²⁰** The poor man is hated even by his neighbor, but many are those who love the rich.

**²¹** He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who shows kindness to the poor.

**²²** Do not those who contrive evil go astray? But those who plan goodness find [^2479] loving devotion and faithfulness.

**²³** There is profit in all labor, but mere talk leads only to poverty.

**²⁴** The crown of the wise is their wealth, but the effort of fools is folly.

**²⁵** A truthful witness saves lives, but one who utters lies is deceitful.

**²⁶** He who fears the LORD is secure in confidence, and his children shall have a place of refuge.

**²⁷** The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death.

**²⁸** A large population is a king’s splendor, but a lack of subjects is a prince’s ruin.

**²⁹** A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man promotes folly.

**³⁰** A tranquil heart is life to the body, but envy rots the bones.

**³¹** Whoever oppresses the poor taunts their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors Him.

**³²** The wicked man is thrown down by his own sin, but the righteous man has a refuge even in death.

**³³** Wisdom rests in the heart of the discerning; even among fools she is known.[^2480]

**³⁴** Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.

**³⁵** A king delights in a wise servant, but his anger falls on the shameful.

[^2478]: 14:16 Or fears the LORD
[^2479]: 14:22 Or show
[^2480]: 14:33 Hebrew; LXX and Syriac but among fools she is not known
