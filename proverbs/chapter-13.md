**³** He who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who opens his lips invites his own ruin.

**⁴** The slacker craves yet has nothing, but the soul of the diligent is fully satisfied.

**⁵** The righteous hate falsehood, but the wicked bring shame and disgrace.

**⁶** Righteousness guards the man of integrity, but wickedness undermines the sinner.

**⁷** One pretends to be rich, but has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.

**⁸** Riches may ransom a man’s life, but a poor man hears no threat.

**⁹** The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.

**¹⁰** Arrogance leads only to strife, but wisdom is with the well-advised.

**¹¹** Dishonest wealth will dwindle, but what is earned through hard work will be multiplied.

**¹²** Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is a tree of life.

**¹³** He who despises instruction will pay the penalty, but the one who respects a command will be rewarded.

**¹⁴** The teaching [^2477] of the wise is a fountain of life, turning one from the snares of death.

**¹⁵** Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the faithless is difficult.

**¹⁶** Every prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool displays his folly.

**¹⁷** A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a faithful envoy brings healing.

**¹⁸** Poverty and shame come to him who ignores discipline, but whoever heeds correction is honored.

**¹⁹** Desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but turning from evil is detestable to fools.

**²⁰** He who walks with the wise will become wise, but the companion of fools will be destroyed.

**²¹** Disaster pursues sinners, but prosperity is the reward of the righteous.

**²²** A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the sinner’s wealth is passed to the righteous.

**²³** Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor, but without justice it is swept away.

**²⁴** He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently.

**²⁵** A righteous man eats to his heart’s content, but the stomach of the wicked is empty.
