# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> A wise son heeds his father’s discipline, but a mocker does not listen to rebuke. 

<sup>2</sup> From the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things, but the desire of the faithless is violence. 

<sup>3</sup> He who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who opens his lips invites his own ruin. 

<sup>4</sup> The slacker craves yet has nothing, but the soul of the diligent is fully satisfied. 

<sup>5</sup> The righteous hate falsehood, but the wicked bring shame and disgrace. 

<sup>6</sup> Righteousness guards the man of integrity, but wickedness undermines the sinner. 

<sup>7</sup> One pretends to be rich, but has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. 

<sup>8</sup> Riches may ransom a man’s life, but a poor man hears no threat. 

<sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is extinguished. 

<sup>10</sup> Arrogance leads only to strife, but wisdom is with the well-advised. 

<sup>11</sup> Dishonest wealth will dwindle, but what is earned through hard work will be multiplied. 

<sup>12</sup> Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is a tree of life. 

<sup>13</sup> He who despises instruction will pay the penalty, but the one who respects a command will be rewarded. 

<sup>14</sup> The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning one from the snares of death. 

<sup>15</sup> Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the faithless is difficult. 

<sup>16</sup> Every prudent man acts with knowledge, but a fool displays his folly. 

<sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a faithful envoy brings healing. 

<sup>18</sup> Poverty and shame come to him who ignores discipline, but whoever heeds correction is honored. 

<sup>19</sup> Desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but turning from evil is detestable to fools. 

<sup>20</sup> He who walks with the wise will become wise, but the companion of fools will be destroyed. 

<sup>21</sup> Disaster pursues sinners, but prosperity is the reward of the righteous. 

<sup>22</sup> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the sinner’s wealth is passed to the righteous. 

<sup>23</sup> Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor, but without justice it is swept away. 

<sup>24</sup> He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently. 

<sup>25</sup> A righteous man eats to his heart’s content, but the stomach of the wicked is empty.
