## The Sayings for King Lemuel

**¹** These are the words of King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him:

**²** What shall I say,[^2521] O my son? What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows?

**³** Do not spend your strength on women or your vigor on those who ruin kings.

**⁴** It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink,

**⁵** lest they drink and forget what is decreed, depriving all the oppressed of justice.

**⁶** Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to the bitter in soul.

**⁷** Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

**⁸** Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the cause of all the dispossessed.

**⁹** Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the poor and needy.

## The Virtues of a Noble Woman

**¹⁰** A wife [^2522] of noble character, who can find? She is far more precious than rubies.

**¹¹** The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he lacks nothing of value.

**¹²** She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life.

**¹³** She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.

**¹⁴** She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.

**¹⁵** She rises while it is still night to provide food for her household and portions for her maidservants.

**¹⁶** She appraises a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard.

**¹⁷** She girds herself [^2523] with strength and shows that her arms are strong.

**¹⁸** She sees that her gain is good, and her lamp is not extinguished at night.

**¹⁹** She stretches out her hands to the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.

**²⁰** She opens her arms to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.

**²¹** When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for they are all clothed in scarlet.[^2524]

**²²** She makes coverings for her bed; her clothing is fine linen and purple.

**²³** Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land.

**²⁴** She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchants.

**²⁵** Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the days to come.

**²⁶** She opens her mouth with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.

**²⁷** She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.

**²⁸** Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband praises her as well:

**²⁹** “Many daughters have done noble things, but you surpass them all!”

**³⁰** Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.

**³¹** Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the gates.
