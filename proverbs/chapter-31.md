# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> These are the words of King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him: 

<sup>2</sup> What shall I say, O my son? What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows? 

<sup>3</sup> Do not spend your strength on women or your vigor on those who ruin kings. 

<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink, 

<sup>5</sup> lest they drink and forget what is decreed, depriving all the oppressed of justice. 

<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to the bitter in soul. 

<sup>7</sup> Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the cause of all the dispossessed. 

<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the poor and needy. 

<sup>10</sup> A wife of noble character, who can find? She is far more precious than rubies. 

<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he lacks nothing of value. 

<sup>12</sup> She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life. 

<sup>13</sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. 

<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. 

<sup>15</sup> She rises while it is still night to provide food for her household and portions for her maidservants. 

<sup>16</sup> She appraises a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard. 

<sup>17</sup> She girds herself with strength and shows that her arms are strong. 

<sup>18</sup> She sees that her gain is good, and her lamp is not extinguished at night. 

<sup>19</sup> She stretches out her hands to the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. 

<sup>20</sup> She opens her arms to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. 

<sup>21</sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for they are all clothed in scarlet. 

<sup>22</sup> She makes coverings for her bed; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 

<sup>23</sup> Her husband is known at the city gate, where he sits among the elders of the land. 

<sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchants. 

<sup>25</sup> Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the days to come. 

<sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. 

<sup>27</sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 

<sup>28</sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband praises her as well: 

<sup>29</sup> “Many daughters have done noble things, but you surpass them all!” 

<sup>30</sup> Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 

<sup>31</sup> Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the gates.
