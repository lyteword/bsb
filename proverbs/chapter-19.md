# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a fool whose lips are perverse. 

<sup>2</sup> Even zeal is no good without knowledge, and he who hurries his footsteps misses the mark. 

<sup>3</sup> A man’s own folly subverts his way, yet his heart rages against the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth attracts many friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies will not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> Many seek the favor of the prince, and everyone is a friend of the gift giver. 

<sup>7</sup> All the brothers of a poor man hate him— how much more do his friends avoid him! He may pursue them with pleading, but they are nowhere to be found. 

<sup>8</sup> He who acquires wisdom loves himself; one who safeguards understanding will find success. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who pours out lies will perish. 

<sup>10</sup> Luxury is unseemly for a fool— how much worse for a slave to rule over princes! 

<sup>11</sup> A man’s insight gives him patience, and his virtue is to overlook an offense. 

<sup>12</sup> A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is his father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping. 

<sup>14</sup> Houses and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

<sup>15</sup> Laziness brings on deep sleep, and an idle soul will suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> He who keeps a commandment preserves his soul, but he who is careless in his ways will die. 

<sup>17</sup> Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD, and He will repay the lender. 

<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for in that there is hope; do not be party to his death. 

<sup>19</sup> A man of great anger must pay the penalty; if you rescue him, you will have to do so again. 

<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days. 

<sup>21</sup> Many plans are in a man’s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail. 

<sup>22</sup> The desire of a man is loving devotion; better to be poor than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of the LORD leads to life, that one may rest content, without visitation from harm. 

<sup>24</sup> The slacker buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> Strike a mocker, and the simple will beware; rebuke the discerning man, and he will gain knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> He who assaults his father or evicts his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace. 

<sup>27</sup> If you cease to hear instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice, and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> Judgments are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.
