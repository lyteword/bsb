# Chapter 28

## The Boldness of the Righteous

<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

<sup>2</sup> A land in rebellion has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.

<sup>3</sup> A destitute leader who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food.

<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them.

<sup>5</sup> Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.

<sup>6</sup> Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a rich man whose ways are perverse.

<sup>7</sup> A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.

<sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by interest and usury lays it up for one who is kind to the poor.

<sup>9</sup> Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law, even his prayer is detestable.

<sup>10</sup> He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good.

<sup>11</sup> A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man with discernment sees through him.

<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.

<sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.

<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who is always reverent,[^2513] but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.

<sup>15</sup> Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.

<sup>16</sup> A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor, but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong his days.

<sup>17</sup> A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit;[^2514] let no one support him.

<sup>18</sup> He who walks with integrity will be kept safe, but whoever is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.

<sup>19</sup> The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.

<sup>20</sup> A faithful man will abound with blessings, but one eager to be rich will not go unpunished.

<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.

<sup>22</sup> A stingy man [^2515] hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty awaits him.

<sup>23</sup> He who rebukes a man will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.

<sup>24</sup> He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,” is a companion to the man who destroys.

<sup>25</sup> A greedy man stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.

<sup>26</sup> He who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.

<sup>27</sup> Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need, but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.

<sup>28</sup> When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous flourish.
