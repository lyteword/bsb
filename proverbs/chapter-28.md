# Chapter 28

## The Boldness of the Righteous

**¹** The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

**²** A land in rebellion has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.

**³** A destitute leader who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food.

**⁴** Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them.

**⁵** Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.

**⁶** Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a rich man whose ways are perverse.

**⁷** A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.

**⁸** He who increases his wealth by interest and usury lays it up for one who is kind to the poor.

**⁹** Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law, even his prayer is detestable.

**¹⁰** He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good.

**¹¹** A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man with discernment sees through him.

**¹²** When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.

**¹³** He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.

**¹⁴** Blessed is the man who is always reverent,[^2513] but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.

**¹⁵** Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.

**¹⁶** A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor, but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong his days.

**¹⁷** A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit;[^2514] let no one support him.

**¹⁸** He who walks with integrity will be kept safe, but whoever is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.

**¹⁹** The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.

**²⁰** A faithful man will abound with blessings, but one eager to be rich will not go unpunished.

**²¹** To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.

**²²** A stingy man [^2515] hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty awaits him.

**²³** He who rebukes a man will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.

**²⁴** He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,” is a companion to the man who destroys.

**²⁵** A greedy man stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.

**²⁶** He who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.

**²⁷** Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need, but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.

**²⁸** When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous flourish.

[^2513]: 28:14 Or always fears the LORD; Hebrew does not include the LORD.
[^2514]: 28:17 Or will be a fugitive until death
[^2515]: 28:22 Hebrew A man whose eye is evil
