## Avoiding Immorality

**(Leviticus 20:10–21; 1 Corinthians 5:1–8)**

**¹** My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,

**²** that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.

**³** Though the lips of the forbidden woman [^2453] drip honey and her speech [^2454] is smoother than oil,

**⁴** in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.

**⁵** Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.[^2455]

**⁶** She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.

**⁷** So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.

**⁸** Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,

**⁹** lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;

**¹⁰** lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.

**¹¹** At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,

**¹²** and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!

**¹³** I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.

**¹⁴** I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”

**¹⁵** Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.

**¹⁶** Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?

**¹⁷** Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.

**¹⁸** May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:

**¹⁹** A loving doe, a graceful fawn— may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated [^2456] by her love forever.

**²⁰** Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?[^2457]

**²¹** For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines [^2458] all his paths.

**²²** The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.

**²³** He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.

[^2453]: 5:3 Or the adulteress
[^2454]: 5:3 Or her palate
[^2455]: 5:5 Or lay hold of Sheol
[^2456]: 5:19 Or be led astray; also in verse 20
[^2457]: 5:20 Or a foreign woman or another man’s wife
[^2458]: 5:21 Or ponders or makes level
