## Avoiding Immorality

**(Leviticus 20:10–21; 1 Corinthians 5:1–8)**

<sup>1</sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,

<sup>2</sup> that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> Though the lips of the forbidden woman [^2453] drip honey and her speech [^2454] is smoother than oil,

<sup>4</sup> in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.

<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.[^2455]

<sup>6</sup> She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.

<sup>7</sup> So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.

<sup>8</sup> Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,

<sup>9</sup> lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;

<sup>10</sup> lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.

<sup>11</sup> At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,

<sup>12</sup> and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!

<sup>13</sup> I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.

<sup>14</sup> I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”

<sup>15</sup> Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.

<sup>16</sup> Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?

<sup>17</sup> Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.

<sup>18</sup> May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:

<sup>19</sup> A loving doe, a graceful fawn— may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated [^2456] by her love forever.

<sup>20</sup> Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?[^2457]

<sup>21</sup> For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines [^2458] all his paths.

<sup>22</sup> The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.

<sup>23</sup> He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.

[^2453]: 5:3 Or the adulteress
[^2454]: 5:3 Or her palate
[^2455]: 5:5 Or lay hold of Sheol
[^2456]: 5:19 Or be led astray; also in verse 20
[^2457]: 5:20 Or a foreign woman or another man’s wife
[^2458]: 5:21 Or ponders or makes level
