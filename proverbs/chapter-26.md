## Similitudes and Instructions

<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor does not befit a fool.

<sup>2</sup> Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.

<sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!

<sup>4</sup> Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be like him.

<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.

<sup>6</sup> Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.

<sup>7</sup> Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.

<sup>8</sup> Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.

<sup>9</sup> Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.

<sup>10</sup> Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passerby.

<sup>11</sup> As a dog returns to its vomit,[^2508] so a fool repeats his folly.

<sup>12</sup> Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

<sup>13</sup> The slacker says, “A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!”

<sup>14</sup> As a door turns on its hinges, so the slacker turns on his bed.

<sup>15</sup> The slacker buries his hand in the dish; it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.

<sup>16</sup> The slacker is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.

<sup>17</sup> Like one who grabs a dog by the ears is a passerby who meddles in a quarrel not his own.

<sup>18</sup> Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,

<sup>19</sup> so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”

<sup>20</sup> Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.

<sup>21</sup> Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.

<sup>22</sup> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.

<sup>23</sup> Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning [^2509] lips and a wicked heart.

<sup>24</sup> A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.

<sup>25</sup> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.

<sup>26</sup> Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.

<sup>27</sup> He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.

<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
