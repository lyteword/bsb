# Chapter 16

## The Reply of the Tongue Is from the LORD

**¹** The plans of the heart belong to man, but the reply of the tongue is from the LORD.

**²** All a man’s ways are pure in his own eyes, but his motives are weighed out by the LORD.

**³** Commit your works to the LORD and your plans will be achieved.

**⁴** The LORD has made everything for His purpose— even the wicked for the day of disaster.

**⁵** Everyone who is proud in heart is detestable to the LORD; be assured that he will not go unpunished.

**⁶** By loving devotion and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns aside from evil.

**⁷** When a man’s ways please the LORD, He makes even the man’s enemies live at peace with him.

**⁸** Better a little with righteousness than great gain with injustice.

**⁹** A man’s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.

**¹⁰** A divine verdict is on the lips of a king; his mouth must not betray justice.

**¹¹** Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are His concern.

**¹²** Wicked behavior is detestable for kings, for a throne is established through righteousness.

**¹³** Righteous lips are a king’s delight, and he who speaks honestly is beloved.

**¹⁴** The wrath of a king is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.

**¹⁵** When a king’s face brightens, there is life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.

**¹⁶** How much better to acquire wisdom than gold! To gain understanding is more desirable than silver.

**¹⁷** The highway of the upright leads away from evil; he who guards his way protects his life.

**¹⁸** Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.

**¹⁹** It is better to be lowly in spirit among the humble than to divide the spoil with the proud.

**²⁰** Whoever heeds instruction will find success,[^2482] and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.

**²¹** The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant speech promotes instruction.

**²²** Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessor, but the discipline of fools is folly.

**²³** The heart of the wise man instructs his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips.

**²⁴** Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

**²⁵** There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

**²⁶** A worker’s appetite works for him because his hunger drives him onward.

**²⁷** A worthless man digs up evil, and his speech [^2483] is like a scorching fire.

**²⁸** A perverse man spreads dissension, and a gossip divides close friends.

**²⁹** A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good.

**³⁰** He who winks his eye devises perversity; he who purses his lips is bent on evil.

**³¹** Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness.

**³²** He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior, and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city.

**³³** The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.

[^2482]: 16:20 Or Whoever speaks prudently will find what is good
[^2483]: 16:27 Or and what is on his lips
