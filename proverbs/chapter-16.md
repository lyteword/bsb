# Chapter 16

## The Reply of the Tongue Is from the LORD

<sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man, but the reply of the tongue is from the LORD.

<sup>2</sup> All a man’s ways are pure in his own eyes, but his motives are weighed out by the LORD.

<sup>3</sup> Commit your works to the LORD and your plans will be achieved.

<sup>4</sup> The LORD has made everything for His purpose— even the wicked for the day of disaster.

<sup>5</sup> Everyone who is proud in heart is detestable to the LORD; be assured that he will not go unpunished.

<sup>6</sup> By loving devotion and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns aside from evil.

<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please the LORD, He makes even the man’s enemies live at peace with him.

<sup>8</sup> Better a little with righteousness than great gain with injustice.

<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.

<sup>10</sup> A divine verdict is on the lips of a king; his mouth must not betray justice.

<sup>11</sup> Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are His concern.

<sup>12</sup> Wicked behavior is detestable for kings, for a throne is established through righteousness.

<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are a king’s delight, and he who speaks honestly is beloved.

<sup>14</sup> The wrath of a king is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.

<sup>15</sup> When a king’s face brightens, there is life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.

<sup>16</sup> How much better to acquire wisdom than gold! To gain understanding is more desirable than silver.

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright leads away from evil; he who guards his way protects his life.

<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.

<sup>19</sup> It is better to be lowly in spirit among the humble than to divide the spoil with the proud.

<sup>20</sup> Whoever heeds instruction will find success,[^2482] and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.

<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant speech promotes instruction.

<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessor, but the discipline of fools is folly.

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise man instructs his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips.

<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

<sup>25</sup> There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

<sup>26</sup> A worker’s appetite works for him because his hunger drives him onward.

<sup>27</sup> A worthless man digs up evil, and his speech [^2483] is like a scorching fire.

<sup>28</sup> A perverse man spreads dissension, and a gossip divides close friends.

<sup>29</sup> A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good.

<sup>30</sup> He who winks his eye devises perversity; he who purses his lips is bent on evil.

<sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness.

<sup>32</sup> He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior, and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city.

<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.

[^2482]: 16:20 Or Whoever speaks prudently will find what is good
[^2483]: 16:27 Or and what is on his lips
