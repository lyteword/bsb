# Chapter 105

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders. 

<sup>3</sup> Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. 

<sup>4</sup> Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always. 

<sup>5</sup> Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced, 

<sup>6</sup> O offspring of His servant Abraham, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones. 

<sup>7</sup> He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations— 

<sup>9</sup> the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac. 

<sup>10</sup> He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant: 

<sup>11</sup> “I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.” 

<sup>12</sup> When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land, 

<sup>13</sup> they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another. 

<sup>14</sup> He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf: 

<sup>15</sup> “Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!” 

<sup>16</sup> He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave. 

<sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons, 

<sup>19</sup> until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right. 

<sup>20</sup> The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free. 

<sup>21</sup> He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance, 

<sup>22</sup> to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes, 

<sup>25</sup> whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and it became dark— yet they defied His words. 

<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die. 

<sup>30</sup> Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers. 

<sup>31</sup> He spoke, and insects swarmed— gnats throughout their country. 

<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land. 

<sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country. 

<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came— young locusts without number. 

<sup>35</sup> They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil. 

<sup>36</sup> Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor. 

<sup>37</sup> He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled. 

<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them. 

<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night. 

<sup>40</sup> They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

<sup>41</sup> He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert. 

<sup>42</sup> For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant. 

<sup>43</sup> He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy. 

<sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor, 

<sup>45</sup> that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!
