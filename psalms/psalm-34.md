# Psalm 34

## Taste and See That the LORD Is Good

**(1 Samuel 21:8–15)**

Of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech,[^2213] so that the king drove him away.[^2214]

<sup>1</sup> I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.

<sup>2</sup> My soul boasts in the LORD; let the oppressed hear and rejoice.

<sup>3</sup> Magnify the LORD with me; let us exalt His name together.

<sup>4</sup> I sought the LORD, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears.

<sup>5</sup> Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; their faces shall never be ashamed.

<sup>6</sup> This poor man called out, and the LORD heard him; He saved him from all his troubles.

<sup>7</sup> The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them.

<sup>8</sup> Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!

<sup>9</sup> Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing.

<sup>10</sup> Young lions go lacking and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.

<sup>11</sup> Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.

<sup>12</sup> Who is the man who delights in life, who desires to see good days?

<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech.

<sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry.[^2215]

<sup>16</sup> But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil,[^2216] to wipe out all memory of them from the earth.

<sup>17</sup> The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles.

<sup>18</sup> The LORD is near to the brokenhearted; He saves the contrite in spirit.

<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all.

<sup>20</sup> He protects all his bones; not one of them will be broken.[^2217]

<sup>21</sup> Evil will slay the wicked, and the haters of the righteous will be condemned.

<sup>22</sup> The LORD redeems His servants, and none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
