# Psalm 126

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers. 

<sup>2</sup> Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.” 

<sup>3</sup> The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy. 

<sup>4</sup> Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev. 

<sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. 

<sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.
