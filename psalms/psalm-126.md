# Psalm 126

## Zion’s Captives Restored

A song of ascents.

**¹** When the LORD restored the captives of Zion,[^2406] we were like dreamers.[^2407]

**²** Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”

**³** The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.

**⁴** Restore our captives,[^2408] O LORD, like streams in the Negev.

**⁵** Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.

**⁶** He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.

[^2406]: 126:1 Or brought back the captives to Zion or restored the fortunes of Zion
[^2407]: 126:1 Or like those restored to health
[^2408]: 126:4 Or Restore our fortunes
