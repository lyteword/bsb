# Chapter 57

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed. 

<sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me. 

<sup>3</sup> He reaches down from heaven and saves me; He rebukes those who trample me. Selah God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth. 

<sup>4</sup> My soul is among the lions; I lie down with ravenous beasts— with men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. 

<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit before me, but they themselves have fallen into it! 

<sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music. 

<sup>8</sup> Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. 

<sup>9</sup> I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples. 

<sup>10</sup> For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens, and Your faithfulness to the clouds. 

<sup>11</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.
