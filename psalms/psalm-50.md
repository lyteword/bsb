# Psalm 50

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from where the sun rises to where it sets. 

<sup>2</sup> From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth. 

<sup>3</sup> Our God approaches and will not be silent! Consuming fire precedes Him, and a tempest rages around Him. 

<sup>4</sup> He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that He may judge His people: 

<sup>5</sup> “Gather to Me My saints, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.” 

<sup>6</sup> And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. 

<sup>7</sup> “Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God. 

<sup>8</sup> I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are ever before Me. 

<sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens, 

<sup>10</sup> for every beast of the forest is Mine— the cattle on a thousand hills. 

<sup>11</sup> I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine. 

<sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. 

<sup>13</sup> Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 

<sup>14</sup> Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High. 

<sup>15</sup> Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me.” 

<sup>16</sup> To the wicked, however, God says, “What right have you to recite My statutes and to bear My covenant on your lips? 

<sup>17</sup> For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you. 

<sup>18</sup> When you see a thief, you befriend him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. 

<sup>19</sup> You unleash your mouth for evil and unharness your tongue for deceit. 

<sup>20</sup> You sit and malign your brother; you slander your own mother’s son. 

<sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But now I rebuke you and accuse you to your face. 

<sup>22</sup> Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you: 

<sup>23</sup> He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and to him who rights his way, I will show the salvation of God.”
