# Psalm 50

## The Mighty One Calls

A Psalm of Asaph.

**¹** The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from where the sun rises to where it sets.

**²** From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.

**³** Our God approaches and will not be silent! Consuming fire precedes Him, and a tempest rages around Him.

**⁴** He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that He may judge His people:

**⁵** “Gather to Me My saints, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”

**⁶** And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge.[^2253] Selah

**⁷** “Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.

**⁸** I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are ever before Me.

**⁹** I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens,

**¹⁰** for every beast of the forest is Mine— the cattle on a thousand hills.

**¹¹** I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.

**¹²** If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.

**¹³** Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

**¹⁴** Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.

**¹⁵** Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me.”

**¹⁶** To the wicked, however, God says, “What right have you to recite My statutes and to bear My covenant on your lips?

**¹⁷** For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you.

**¹⁸** When you see a thief, you befriend him, and throw in your lot with adulterers.

**¹⁹** You unleash your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.

**²⁰** You sit and malign your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.

**²¹** You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was [^2254] just like you. But now I rebuke you and accuse you to your face.[^2255]

**²²** Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:

**²³** He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and to him who rightly orders his way, I will show the salvation of God.”

[^2253]: 50:6 Or He is a God of justice
[^2254]: 50:21 Or you thought the ‘I AM’ was
[^2255]: 50:21 Literally and I set it in order before your eyes
