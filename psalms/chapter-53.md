# Chapter 53

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath. A Maskil of David. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their ways are vile. There is no one who does good. 

<sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God. 

<sup>3</sup> All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. 

<sup>4</sup> Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon God. 

<sup>5</sup> There they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to fear. For God has scattered the bones of those who besieged you. You put them to shame, for God has despised them. 

<sup>6</sup> Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
