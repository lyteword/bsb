# Psalm 99

## The LORD Reigns!

**(Psalms 93:1–5)**

**¹** The LORD reigns; let the nations tremble! He is enthroned above the cherubim; let the earth quake!

**²** Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples.

**³** Let them praise Your great and awesome name— He is holy![^2350]

**⁴** The mighty King loves justice.[^2351] You have established equity; You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob.

**⁵** Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy!

**⁶** Moses and Aaron were among His priests; Samuel was among those who called on His name. They called to the LORD and He answered.

**⁷** He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them.

**⁸** O LORD our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, yet an avenger of their misdeeds.

**⁹** Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.

[^2350]: 99:3 Or it is holy!
[^2351]: 99:4 Or The might of the King loves justice.
