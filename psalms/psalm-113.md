# Psalm 113

## The LORD Exalts the Humble

**(1 Samuel 1:1–8)**

**¹** Hallelujah![^2382] Give praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD.

**²** Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore.

**³** From where the sun rises to where it sets, the name of the LORD is praised.

**⁴** The LORD is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens.

**⁵** Who is like the LORD our God, the One enthroned on high?

**⁶** He humbles Himself to behold the heavens and the earth.

**⁷** He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the dump

**⁸** to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people.

**⁹** He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother to her children. Hallelujah!

[^2382]: 113:1 Or Hallelu YAH, meaning Praise the LORD; also in verse 9
