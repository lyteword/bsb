# Psalm 15

## Who May Dwell on Your Holy Mountain?

A Psalm of David.

**¹** O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?

**²** He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart,

**³** who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend,

**⁴** who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath,

**⁵** who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
