# Psalm 15

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? 

<sup>2</sup> He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart, 

<sup>3</sup> who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend, 

<sup>4</sup> who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath, 

<sup>5</sup> who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
