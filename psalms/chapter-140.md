# Chapter 140

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence, 

<sup>2</sup> who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long. 

<sup>3</sup> They sharpen their tongues like snakes; the venom of vipers is on their lips. 

<sup>4</sup> Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble. 

<sup>5</sup> The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. 

<sup>6</sup> I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Hear, O LORD, my cry for help. 

<sup>7</sup> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. 

<sup>9</sup> May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused. 

<sup>10</sup> May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again. 

<sup>11</sup> May no slanderer be established in the land; may calamity hunt down the man of violence. 

<sup>12</sup> I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.
