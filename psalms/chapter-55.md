# Chapter 55

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea. 

<sup>2</sup> Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught 

<sup>3</sup> at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they release disaster upon me and revile me in their anger. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart murmurs within me, and the terrors of death assail me. 

<sup>5</sup> Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest. 

<sup>7</sup> How far away I would flee! In the wilderness I would remain. 

<sup>8</sup> I would hurry to my shelter, far from this raging tempest.” 

<sup>9</sup> O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city. 

<sup>10</sup> Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within. 

<sup>11</sup> Destruction is within; oppression and deceit never leave the streets. 

<sup>12</sup> For it is not an enemy who insults me; that I could endure. It is not a foe who rises against me; from him I could hide. 

<sup>13</sup> But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend. 

<sup>14</sup> We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God. 

<sup>15</sup> Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes. 

<sup>16</sup> But I call to God, and the LORD saves me. 

<sup>17</sup> Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice. 

<sup>18</sup> He redeems my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me. 

<sup>19</sup> God will hear and humiliate them— the One enthroned for the ages— Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God. 

<sup>20</sup> My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant. 

<sup>21</sup> His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed. 

<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken. 

<sup>23</sup> But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
