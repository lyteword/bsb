# Psalm 48

## Broken Bondage

A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

**¹** Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, His holy mountain.

**²** Beautiful in loftiness, the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphon [^2246] is Mount Zion, the city of the great King.

**³** God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself to be a fortress.

**⁴** For behold, the kings assembled; they all advanced together.

**⁵** They saw and were astounded; they fled in terror.

**⁶** Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor.

**⁷** With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish.[^2247]

**⁸** As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah

**⁹** Within Your temple, O God, we contemplate Your loving devotion.

**¹⁰** Your name, O God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.

**¹¹** Mount Zion is glad, the daughters [^2248] of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments.

**¹²** March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers,

**¹³** consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation.

**¹⁴** For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even till death.[^2249]

[^2246]: 48:2 Or in the far north; the most sacred mountain of the Canaanites was Zaphon
[^2247]: 48:7 Or a fleet of trading ships
[^2248]: 48:11 Or the villages
[^2249]: 48:14 Or He will guide us beyond death
