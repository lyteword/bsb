# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new songâ€” His praise in the assembly of the godly. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp. 

<sup>4</sup> For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands, 

<sup>7</sup> to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 

<sup>8</sup> to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with shackles of iron, 

<sup>9</sup> to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!
