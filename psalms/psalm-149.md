# Psalm 149

## Sing to the LORD a New Song

**(Psalms 98:1–9; Isaiah 42:10–17)**

**¹** Hallelujah![^2435] Sing to the LORD a new song— His praise in the assembly of the godly.

**²** Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.

**³** Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.

**⁴** For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation.

**⁵** Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.

**⁶** May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands,

**⁷** to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,

**⁸** to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with shackles of iron,

**⁹** to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!

[^2435]: 149:1 Or Hallelu YAH, meaning Praise the LORD; also in verse 9
