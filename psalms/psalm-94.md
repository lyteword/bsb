# Psalm 94

## The LORD Will Not Forget His People

**¹** O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth.

**²** Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.

**³** How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked exult?

**⁴** They pour out arrogant words; all workers of iniquity boast.

**⁵** They crush Your people, O LORD; they oppress Your heritage.

**⁶** They kill the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.

**⁷** They say, “The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.”

**⁸** Take notice, O senseless among the people! O fools, when will you be wise?

**⁹** He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? He who formed the eye, can He not see?

**¹⁰** He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge?

**¹¹** The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.[^2343]

**¹²** Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD, and teach from Your law,

**¹³** to grant him relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.

**¹⁴** For the LORD will not forsake His people; He will never abandon His heritage.

**¹⁵** Surely judgment will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.

**¹⁶** Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?

**¹⁷** Unless the LORD had been my helper, I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.

**¹⁸** If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me.

**¹⁹** When anxiety overwhelms me, Your consolation delights my soul.

**²⁰** Can a corrupt throne be Your ally— one devising mischief by decree?

**²¹** They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.[^2344]

**²²** But the LORD has been my stronghold, and my God is my rock of refuge.

**²³** He will bring upon them their own iniquity and destroy them for their wickedness. The LORD our God will destroy them.
