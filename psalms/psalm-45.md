# Psalm 45

## My Heart Is Stirred by a Noble Theme

**(1 Kings 3:1–15; 2 Chronicles 1:1–13; Psalms 72:1–20)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies.” A Maskil [^2240] of the sons of Korah. A love song.

**¹** My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king;[^2241] my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.

**²** You are the most handsome of men; grace has anointed your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.

**³** Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior; appear in your majesty and splendor.

**⁴** In your splendor ride forth in victory on behalf of truth and humility and justice; may your right hand show your awesome deeds.

**⁵** Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s foes; the nations fall beneath your feet.

**⁶** Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever, and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.

**⁷** You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you above your companions with the oil of joy.[^2242]

**⁸** All your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces of ivory the harps make you glad.

**⁹** The daughters of kings are among your honored women; the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with the gold of Ophir.

**¹⁰** Listen, O daughter! Consider and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father’s house,

**¹¹** and the king will desire your beauty; bow to him, for he is your lord.

**¹²** The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; men of wealth will seek your favor.

**¹³** All glorious is the princess in her chamber; her gown is embroidered with gold.

**¹⁴** In colorful garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions are brought before you.

**¹⁵** They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king.

**¹⁶** Your sons will succeed your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.

**¹⁷** I will commemorate your name through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.
