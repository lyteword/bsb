# Psalm 142

## I Lift My Voice to the LORD

**(1 Samuel 22:1–5; Psalms 57:1–11)**

A Maskil [^2423] of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.

**¹** I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy.

**²** I pour out my complaint before Him; I reveal my trouble to Him.

**³** Although my spirit grows faint within me, You know my way. Along the path I travel they have hidden a snare for me.

**⁴** Look to my right and see; no one attends to me. There is no refuge for me; no one cares for my soul.

**⁵** I cry to You, O LORD: “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”

**⁶** Listen to my cry, for I am brought quite low. Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are too strong for me.

**⁷** Free my soul from prison, that I may praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness to me.

[^2423]: 142:0 Maskil is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 32, 42, 44–45, 52–55, 74, 78, 88–89, and 142.
