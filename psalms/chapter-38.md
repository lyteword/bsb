# Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, for remembrance. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me. 

<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger; there is no rest in my bones because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear. 

<sup>5</sup> My wounds are foul and festering because of my sinful folly. 

<sup>6</sup> I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning. 

<sup>7</sup> For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body. 

<sup>8</sup> I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. 

<sup>9</sup> O Lord, my every desire is before You; my groaning is not hidden from You. 

<sup>10</sup> My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded. 

<sup>11</sup> My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance. 

<sup>12</sup> Those who seek my life lay snares; those who wish me harm speak destruction, plotting deceit all day long. 

<sup>13</sup> But like a deaf man, I do not hear; and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> I am like a man who cannot hear, whose mouth offers no reply. 

<sup>15</sup> I wait for You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God. 

<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Let them not gloat over me— those who taunt me when my foot slips.” 

<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me. 

<sup>18</sup> Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> Many are my enemies without cause, and many hate me without reason. 

<sup>20</sup> Those who repay my good with evil attack me for pursuing the good. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not forsake me, O LORD; be not far from me, O my God. 

<sup>22</sup> Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.
