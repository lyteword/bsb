# Psalm 109

## The Song of the Slandered

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> O God of my praise, be not silent.

<sup>2</sup> For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.

<sup>3</sup> They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.

<sup>4</sup> In return for my love they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.

<sup>5</sup> They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

<sup>6</sup> Set over him a wicked man; let an accuser stand at his right hand.

<sup>7</sup> When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayer be regarded as sin.

<sup>8</sup> May his days be few; may another take his position.[^2375]

<sup>9</sup> May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.

<sup>10</sup> May his children wander as beggars, seeking sustenance [^2376] far from their ruined homes.

<sup>11</sup> May the creditor seize all he owns, and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.

<sup>12</sup> May there be no one to extend kindness to him, and no one to favor his fatherless children.

<sup>13</sup> May his descendants be cut off; may their name be blotted out from the next generation.

<sup>14</sup> May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and the sin of his mother never be blotted out.

<sup>15</sup> May their sins always remain before the LORD, that He may cut off their memory from the earth.

<sup>16</sup> For he never thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, even to their death.

<sup>17</sup> The cursing that he loved, may it fall on him; the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.

<sup>18</sup> The cursing that he wore like a coat, may it soak into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.

<sup>19</sup> May it be like a robe wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.

<sup>20</sup> May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me.

<sup>21</sup> But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion.

<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy; my heart is wounded within me.

<sup>23</sup> I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.

<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak from fasting, and my body grows lean and gaunt.

<sup>25</sup> I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.

<sup>26</sup> Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to Your loving devotion.

<sup>27</sup> Let them know that this is Your hand, that You, O LORD, have done it.

<sup>28</sup> Though they curse, You will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but Your servant will rejoice.

<sup>29</sup> May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; may they wear their shame like a robe.

<sup>30</sup> With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; I will praise Him in the presence of many.

<sup>31</sup> For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from the condemners of his soul.
