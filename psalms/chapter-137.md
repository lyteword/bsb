# Chapter 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> There on the willows we hung our harps, 

<sup>3</sup> for there our captors requested a song; our tormentors demanded songs of joy: “Sing us a song of Zion.” 

<sup>4</sup> How can we sing a song of the LORD in a foreign land? 

<sup>5</sup> If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand cease to function. 

<sup>6</sup> May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy! 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem fell: “Destroy it,” they said, “tear it down to its foundations!” 

<sup>8</sup> O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, blessed is he who repays you as you have done to us. 

<sup>9</sup> Blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
