# Chapter 114

<sup>1</sup> When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue, 

<sup>2</sup> Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary, and Israel His dominion. 

<sup>3</sup> The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back; 

<sup>4</sup> the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 

<sup>5</sup> Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back, 

<sup>6</sup> O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs? 

<sup>7</sup> Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

<sup>8</sup> who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
