# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.” A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from saving me, so far from my words of groaning? 

<sup>2</sup> I cry out by day, O my God, but You do not answer, and by night, but I have no rest. 

<sup>3</sup> Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them. 

<sup>5</sup> They cried out to You and were set free; they trusted in You and were not disappointed. 

<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people. 

<sup>7</sup> All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads: 

<sup>8</sup> “He trusts in the LORD, let the LORD deliver him; let the LORD rescue him, since He delights in him.” 

<sup>9</sup> Yet You brought me forth from the womb; You made me secure at my mother’s breast. 

<sup>10</sup> From birth I was cast upon You; from my mother’s womb You have been my God. 

<sup>11</sup> Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. 

<sup>12</sup> Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. 

<sup>13</sup> They open their jaws against me like lions that roar and maul. 

<sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed. My heart is like wax; it melts away within me. 

<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me in the dust of death. 

<sup>16</sup> For dogs surround me; a band of evil men encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet. 

<sup>17</sup> I can count all my bones; they stare and gloat over me. 

<sup>18</sup> They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. 

<sup>19</sup> But You, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me. 

<sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of wild dogs. 

<sup>21</sup> Save me from the mouth of the lion; at the horns of the wild oxen You have answered me! 

<sup>22</sup> I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; I will praise You in the assembly. 

<sup>23</sup> You who fear the LORD, praise Him! All descendants of Jacob, honor Him! All offspring of Israel, revere Him! 

<sup>24</sup> For He has not despised or detested the torment of the afflicted. He has not hidden His face from him, but has attended to his cry for help. 

<sup>25</sup> My praise for You resounds in the great assembly; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear You. 

<sup>26</sup> The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise Him. May your hearts live forever! 

<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before Him. 

<sup>28</sup> For dominion belongs to the LORD and He rules over the nations. 

<sup>29</sup> All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him— even those unable to preserve their lives. 

<sup>30</sup> Posterity will serve Him; they will declare the Lord to a new generation. 

<sup>31</sup> They will come and proclaim His righteousness to a people yet unborn— all that He has done.
