# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> Of David. To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul; 

<sup>2</sup> in You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who are faithless without cause will be disgraced. 

<sup>4</sup> Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths. 

<sup>5</sup> Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You. 

<sup>6</sup> Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion, for they are from age to age. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellious acts; remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness, O LORD. 

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way. 

<sup>9</sup> He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way. 

<sup>10</sup> All the LORDâ€™s ways are loving and faithful to those who keep His covenant and His decrees. 

<sup>11</sup> For the sake of Your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great. 

<sup>12</sup> Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the path chosen for him. 

<sup>13</sup> His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD confides in those who fear Him, and reveals His covenant to them. 

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are always on the LORD, for He will free my feet from the mesh. 

<sup>16</sup> Turn to me and be gracious, for I am lonely and afflicted. 

<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart increase; free me from my distress. 

<sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins. 

<sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with vicious hatred. 

<sup>20</sup> Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You. 

<sup>21</sup> May integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for You. 

<sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
