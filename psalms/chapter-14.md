# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God. 

<sup>3</sup> All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. 

<sup>4</sup> Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter. 

<sup>7</sup> Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
