# Psalm 52

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Maskil of David. After Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, “David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.” Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The loving devotion of God endures all day long. 

<sup>2</sup> Your tongue devises destruction like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit. 

<sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good, falsehood more than speaking truth. 

<sup>4</sup> You love every word that devours, O deceitful tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. 

<sup>6</sup> The righteous will see and fear; they will mock the evildoer, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> “Look at the man who did not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his wealth and strengthened himself by destruction.” 

<sup>8</sup> But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in the loving devotion of God forever and ever. 

<sup>9</sup> I will praise You forever, because You have done it. I will wait on Your name— for it is good— in the presence of Your saints.
