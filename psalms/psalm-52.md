# Psalm 52

## Why Do You Boast of Evil?

**(1 Samuel 22:6–23)**

For the choirmaster. A Maskil [^2258] of David. After Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, “David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.”

**¹** Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The loving devotion of God endures all day long.

**²** Your tongue devises destruction like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit.

**³** You love evil more than good, falsehood more than speaking truth. Selah

**⁴** You love every word that devours, O deceitful tongue.

**⁵** Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah

**⁶** The righteous will see and fear; they will mock the evildoer, saying,

**⁷** “Look at the man who did not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his wealth and strengthened himself by destruction.”

**⁸** But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in the loving devotion of God forever and ever.

**⁹** I will praise You forever, because You have done it. I will wait on Your name— for it is good— in the presence of Your saints.

[^2258]: 52:0 Maskil is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 32, 42, 44–45, 52–55, 74, 78, 88–89, and 142.
