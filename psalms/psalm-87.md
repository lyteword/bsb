# Psalm 87

## The LORD Loves the Gates of Zion

A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A song.

**¹** He has founded His city on the holy mountains.[^2330]

**²** The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

**³** Glorious things are ascribed to you, O city of God. Selah

**⁴** “I will mention Rahab [^2331] and Babylon among those who know Me— along with Philistia, Tyre, and Cush [^2332]— when I say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’”

**⁵** And it will be said of Zion: “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High Himself will establish her.”

**⁶** The LORD will record in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.” Selah

**⁷** Singers and pipers will proclaim, “All my springs of joy are in You.”

[^2330]: 87:1 Literally His foundation is on the holy mountains
[^2331]: 87:4 Rahab is a poetic name for Egypt.
[^2332]: 87:4 That is, the upper Nile region
