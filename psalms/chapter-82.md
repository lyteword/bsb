# Chapter 82

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. God presides in the divine assembly; He renders judgment among the gods: 

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? 

<sup>3</sup> Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed. 

<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> They do not know or understand; they wander in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 

<sup>6</sup> I have said, ‘You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.’ 

<sup>7</sup> But like mortals you will die, and like rulers you will fall.” 

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are Your inheritance.
