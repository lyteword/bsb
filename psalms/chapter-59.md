# Chapter 59

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me. 

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed. 

<sup>3</sup> See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice. 

<sup>5</sup> O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. 

<sup>6</sup> They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city. 

<sup>7</sup> See what they spew from their mouths— sharp words from their lips: “For who can hear us?” 

<sup>8</sup> But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations. 

<sup>9</sup> I will keep watch for You, O my strength, because You, O God, are my fortress. 

<sup>10</sup> My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes. 

<sup>11</sup> Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield. 

<sup>12</sup> By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter. 

<sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. 

<sup>14</sup> They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city. 

<sup>15</sup> They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied. 

<sup>16</sup> But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble. 

<sup>17</sup> To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.
