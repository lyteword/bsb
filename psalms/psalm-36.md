# Psalm 36

## The Transgression of the Wicked

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.

**¹** An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes.[^2222]

**²** For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin.

**³** The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.

**⁴** Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he fails to reject evil.

**⁵** Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.

**⁶** Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments are like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.

**⁷** How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings!

**⁸** They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights.

**⁹** For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.

**¹⁰** Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

**¹¹** Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.

**¹²** There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.

[^2222]: 36:1 Cited in Romans 3:18
