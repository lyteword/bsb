# Psalm 36

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin. 

<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing. 

<sup>4</sup> Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he fails to reject evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds. 

<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments are like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast. 

<sup>7</sup> How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings! 

<sup>8</sup> They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights. 

<sup>9</sup> For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light. 

<sup>10</sup> Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

<sup>12</sup> There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.
