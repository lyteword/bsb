# Psalm 14

## The Fool Says There Is No God

**(Psalms 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17; Romans 3:9–20)**

For the choirmaster. Of David.

**¹** The fool [^2164] says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good.

**²** The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.

**³** All have turned away, they have together become corrupt;[^2165] there is no one who does good, not even one.[^2166]

**⁴** Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.

**⁵** There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous.

**⁶** You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter.

**⁷** Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!

[^2164]: 14:1 The Hebrew words rendered fool throughout the Psalms denote one who is morally deficient.
[^2165]: 14:3 LXX worthless
[^2166]: 14:3 Cited in Romans 3:10–12
