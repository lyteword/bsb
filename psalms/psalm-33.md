# Psalm 33

## Praise to the Creator

**(Psalms 148:1–14)**

**¹** Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones; it is fitting for the upright to praise Him.

**²** Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to Him with ten strings.

**³** Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy.

**⁴** For the word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy.

**⁵** The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His loving devotion.

**⁶** By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.

**⁷** He piles up the waters of the sea; He puts the depths into storehouses.

**⁸** Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him.

**⁹** For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.

**¹⁰** The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples.

**¹¹** The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the purposes of His heart to all generations.

**¹²** Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance!

**¹³** The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.

**¹⁴** From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth.

**¹⁵** He shapes the hearts of each; He considers all their works.

**¹⁶** No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by his great strength.

**¹⁷** A horse is a vain hope for salvation; even its great strength cannot save.

**¹⁸** Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His loving devotion

**¹⁹** to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.

**²⁰** Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.

**²¹** For our hearts rejoice in Him, since we trust in His holy name.

**²²** May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, as we put our hope in You.
