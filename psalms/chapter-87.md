# Chapter 87

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A song. He has founded His city on the holy mountains. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are ascribed to you, O city of God. 

<sup>4</sup> “I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me— along with Philistia, Tyre, and Cush — when I say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’” 

<sup>5</sup> And it will be said of Zion: “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High Himself will establish her.” 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD will record in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.” 

<sup>7</sup> Singers and pipers will proclaim, “All my springs of joy are in You.”
