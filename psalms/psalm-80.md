# Psalm 80

## Hear Us, O Shepherd of Israel

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph.

**¹** Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth

**²** before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your mighty power and come to save us.

**³** Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.

**⁴** O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?

**⁵** You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink the full measure of their tears.

**⁶** You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us.

**⁷** Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.

**⁸** You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.

**⁹** You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.

**¹⁰** The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.

**¹¹** It sent out its branches to the Sea,[^2318] and its shoots toward the River.[^2319]

**¹²** Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?

**¹³** The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.

**¹⁴** Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine—

**¹⁵** the root Your right hand has planted, the son You have raised up for Yourself.

**¹⁶** Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.

**¹⁷** Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself.

**¹⁸** Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.

**¹⁹** Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
