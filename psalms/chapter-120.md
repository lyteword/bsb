# Chapter 120

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me. 

<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue? 

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree! 

<sup>5</sup> Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar! 

<sup>6</sup> Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace. 

<sup>7</sup> I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
