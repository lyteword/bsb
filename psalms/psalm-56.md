# Psalm 56

## Be Merciful to Me, O God

**(1 Samuel 21:8–15)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam [^2266] of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day they press their attack.

<sup>2</sup> My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me.

<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I put my trust in You.

<sup>4</sup> In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are on my demise.

<sup>6</sup> They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.

<sup>7</sup> In spite of such sin, will they escape?[^2267] In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations.

<sup>8</sup> You have taken account of my wanderings.[^2268] Put my tears in Your bottle— are they not in Your book?

<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side.

<sup>10</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,

<sup>11</sup> in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

<sup>12</sup> Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.

<sup>13</sup> For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.

[^2266]: 56:0 Miktam is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 16 and 56–60.
[^2267]: 56:7 Or do not let them escape; MT does not include do not.
[^2268]: 56:8 Or sorrows
