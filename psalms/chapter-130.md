# Chapter 130

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD! 

<sup>2</sup> O Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy. 

<sup>3</sup> If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand? 

<sup>4</sup> But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared. 

<sup>5</sup> I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope. 

<sup>6</sup> My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morningâ€” more than watchmen wait for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance. 

<sup>8</sup> And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.
