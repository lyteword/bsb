# Psalm 104

## How Many Are Your Works, O LORD!

**¹** Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty.

**²** He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; He stretches out the heavens like a tent,

**³** laying the beams of His chambers in the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind.

**⁴** He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.[^2354]

**⁵** He set the earth on its foundations, never to be moved.

**⁶** You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.

**⁷** At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—

**⁸** the mountains rose and the valleys sank to the place You assigned for them—

**⁹** You set a boundary they cannot cross, that they may never again cover the earth.

**¹⁰** He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains.

**¹¹** They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.

**¹²** The birds of the air nest beside the springs; they sing among the branches.

**¹³** He waters the mountains from His chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.

**¹⁴** He makes the grass grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:

**¹⁵** wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil that makes his face to shine, and bread that sustains his heart.

**¹⁶** The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted,

**¹⁷** where the birds build their nests; the stork makes her home in the cypresses.[^2355]

**¹⁸** The high mountains are for the wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers.[^2356]

**¹⁹** He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.

**²⁰** You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl.

**²¹** The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.

**²²** The sun rises, and they withdraw; they lie down in their dens.

**²³** Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.

**²⁴** How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.

**²⁵** Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number, living things both great and small.

**²⁶** There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.

**²⁷** All creatures look to You to give them their food in due season.

**²⁸** When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.

**²⁹** When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to dust.

**³⁰** When You send Your Spirit,[^2357] they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.

**³¹** May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.

**³²** He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smolder.

**³³** I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

**³⁴** May my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD.

**³⁵** May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah![^2358]
