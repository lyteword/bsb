# Chapter 116

<sup>1</sup> I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice— my appeal for mercy. 

<sup>2</sup> Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live. 

<sup>3</sup> The ropes of death entangled me; the anguish of Sheol overcame me; I was confronted by trouble and sorrow. 

<sup>4</sup> Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, deliver my soul!” 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD preserves the simplehearted; I was helpless, and He saved me. 

<sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you. 

<sup>8</sup> For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 

<sup>9</sup> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 

<sup>10</sup> I believed, therefore I said, “I am greatly afflicted.” 

<sup>11</sup> In my alarm I said, “All men are liars!” 

<sup>12</sup> How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me? 

<sup>13</sup> I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD. 

<sup>14</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people. 

<sup>15</sup> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. 

<sup>16</sup> Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have broken my bonds. 

<sup>17</sup> I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD. 

<sup>18</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people, 

<sup>19</sup> in the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
