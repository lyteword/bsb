# Psalm 139

## You Have Searched Me and Known Me

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** O LORD, You have searched me and known me.

**²** You know when I sit and when I rise; You understand my thoughts from afar.

**³** You search out my path and my lying down; You are aware of all my ways.

**⁴** Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, O LORD.

**⁵** You hem me in behind and before; You have laid Your hand upon me.

**⁶** Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.

**⁷** Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?

**⁸** If I ascend to the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.

**⁹** If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle by the farthest sea,

**¹⁰** even there Your hand will guide me; Your right hand will hold me fast.

**¹¹** If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light become night around me”—

**¹²** even the darkness is not dark to You, but the night shines like the day, for darkness is as light to You.

**¹³** For You formed my inmost being;[^2418] You knit me together in my mother’s womb.

**¹⁴** I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are Your works, and I know this very well.

**¹⁵** My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.

**¹⁶** Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in Your book and ordained for me before one of them came to be.

**¹⁷** How precious to me are Your thoughts,[^2419] O God, how vast is their sum!

**¹⁸** If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; and when I awake, I am still with You.

**¹⁹** O God, that You would slay the wicked— away from me, you bloodthirsty men—

**²⁰** who speak of You deceitfully; Your enemies take Your name in vain.[^2420]

**²¹** Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD, and detest those who rise against You?

**²²** I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them as my enemies.

**²³** Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.

**²⁴** See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the way everlasting.

[^2418]: 139:13 Hebrew my kidneys
[^2419]: 139:17 Or How amazing are Your thoughts concerning me
[^2420]: 139:20 Hebrew Your enemies take in vain or Your enemies bear up in vain; LXX Your enemies take Your cities in vain
