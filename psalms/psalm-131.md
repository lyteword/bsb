# Psalm 131

## I Have Stilled My Soul

A song of ascents. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty. I do not aspire to great things or matters too lofty for me.

<sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.

<sup>3</sup> O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forevermore.
