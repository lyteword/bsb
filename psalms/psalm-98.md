# Psalm 98

## Sing to the LORD a New Song

**(Psalms 149:1–9; Isaiah 42:10–17)**

A Psalm.

**¹** Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done wonders; His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory.

**²** The LORD has proclaimed His salvation and revealed His righteousness to the nations.

**³** He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

**⁴** Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth—let your cry ring out, and sing praises!

**⁵** Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, in melodious song with the harp.

**⁶** With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.

**⁷** Let the sea resound, and all that fills it, the world, and all who dwell in it.

**⁸** Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy

**⁹** before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
