# Psalm 98

## Sing to the LORD a New Song

**(Psalms 149:1–9; Isaiah 42:10–17)**

A Psalm.

<sup>1</sup> Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done wonders; His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory.

<sup>2</sup> The LORD has proclaimed His salvation and revealed His righteousness to the nations.

<sup>3</sup> He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

<sup>4</sup> Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth—let your cry ring out, and sing praises!

<sup>5</sup> Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, in melodious song with the harp.

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.

<sup>7</sup> Let the sea resound, and all that fills it, the world, and all who dwell in it.

<sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy

<sup>9</sup> before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
