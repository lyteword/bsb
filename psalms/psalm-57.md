# Psalm 57

## In You My Soul Takes Refuge

**(1 Samuel 22:1–5; Psalms 108:1–13; Psalms 142:1–7)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam [^2269] of David, when he fled from Saul into the cave.

<sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed.

<sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High,[^2270] to God who fulfills His purpose for me.

<sup>3</sup> He reaches down from heaven and saves me; He rebukes those who trample me. Selah God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth.

<sup>4</sup> My soul is among the lions; I lie down with ravenous beasts— with men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.

<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit before me, but they themselves have fallen into it! Selah

<sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music.

<sup>8</sup> Awake, my glory![^2271] Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.

<sup>9</sup> I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.

<sup>10</sup> For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens, and Your faithfulness to the clouds.

<sup>11</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.

[^2269]: 57:0 Miktam is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 16 and 56–60.
[^2270]: 57:2 Hebrew Elohim-Elyon
[^2271]: 57:8 Or Awake, my soul!
