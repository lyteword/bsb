# Psalm 125

## The LORD Surrounds His People

A song of ascents.

**¹** Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever.

**²** As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.

**³** For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.

**⁴** Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart.

**⁵** But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
