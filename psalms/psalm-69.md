# Psalm 69

## The Waters Are up to My Neck

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.

**¹** Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck.

**²** I have sunk into the miry depths, where there is no footing; I have drifted into deep waters, where the flood engulfs me.

**³** I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.

**⁴** Those who hate me without cause outnumber the hairs of my head; many are those who would destroy me— my enemies for no reason.[^2291] Though I did not steal, I must repay.

**⁵** You know my folly, O God, and my guilt is not hidden from You.

**⁶** May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of Hosts; may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel.

**⁷** For I have endured scorn for Your sake, and shame has covered my face.

**⁸** I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons,

**⁹** because zeal for Your house has consumed me,[^2292] and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.[^2293]

**¹⁰** I wept and fasted, but it brought me reproach.

**¹¹** I made sackcloth my clothing, and I was sport to them.

**¹²** Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of drunkards.

**¹³** But my prayer to You, O LORD, is for a time of favor. In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, answer me with Your sure salvation.

**¹⁴** Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink; deliver me from my foes and out of the deep waters.

**¹⁵** Do not let the floods engulf me or the depths swallow me up; let not the Pit close its mouth over me.

**¹⁶** Answer me, O LORD, for Your loving devotion is good; turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion.

**¹⁷** Hide not Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly!

**¹⁸** Draw near to my soul and redeem me; ransom me because of my foes.

**¹⁹** You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. All my adversaries are before You.

**²⁰** Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found no one.

**²¹** They poisoned my food with gall and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst.

**²²** May their table become a snare; may it be a retribution and a trap.[^2294]

**²³** May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.[^2295]

**²⁴** Pour out Your wrath upon them, and let Your burning anger overtake them.

**²⁵** May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.[^2296]

**²⁶** For they persecute the one You struck and recount the pain of those You wounded.

**²⁷** Add iniquity to their iniquity; let them not share in Your righteousness.

**²⁸** May they be blotted out of the Book of Life and not listed with the righteous.

**²⁹** But I am in pain and distress; let Your salvation protect me, O God.

**³⁰** I will praise God’s name in song and exalt Him with thanksgiving.

**³¹** And this will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves.

**³²** The humble will see and rejoice. You who seek God, let your hearts be revived!

**³³** For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise His captive people.

**³⁴** Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them.

**³⁵** For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it.

**³⁶** The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will settle in it.
