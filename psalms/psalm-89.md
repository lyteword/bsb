# Psalm 89

## I Will Sing of His Love Forever

A Maskil [^2336] of Ethan the Ezrahite.

**¹** I will sing of the loving devotion of the LORD forever; with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations.

**²** For I have said, “Loving devotion is built up forever; in the heavens You establish Your faithfulness.”

**³** You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant:

**⁴** ‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’” Selah

**⁵** The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD— Your faithfulness as well— in the assembly of the holy ones.

**⁶** For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings [^2337] is like the LORD?

**⁷** In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared, and awesome above all who surround Him.

**⁸** O LORD God of Hosts, who is like You? O mighty LORD, Your faithfulness surrounds You.

**⁹** You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them.

**¹⁰** You crushed Rahab like a carcass; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.

**¹¹** The heavens are Yours, and also the earth. The earth and its fullness You founded.

**¹²** North and south You created; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.

**¹³** Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand. Your right hand is exalted.

**¹⁴** Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; loving devotion and faithfulness go before You.

**¹⁵** Blessed are those who know the joyful sound, who walk, O LORD, in the light of Your presence.

**¹⁶** They rejoice in Your name all day long, and in Your righteousness they exult.

**¹⁷** For You are the glory of their strength, and by Your favor our horn is exalted.

**¹⁸** Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.

**¹⁹** You once spoke in a vision; to Your godly ones You said, “I have bestowed help on a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people.

**²⁰** I have found My servant David; with My sacred oil I have anointed him.

**²¹** My hand will sustain him; surely My arm will strengthen him.

**²²** No enemy will exact tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.

**²³** I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.

**²⁴** My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted.

**²⁵** I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand upon the rivers.

**²⁶** He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation.’

**²⁷** I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.

**²⁸** I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, and My covenant with him will stand fast.

**²⁹** I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.

**³⁰** If his sons forsake My law and do not walk in My judgments,

**³¹** if they violate My statutes and fail to keep My commandments,

**³²** I will attend to their transgression with the rod, and to their iniquity with stripes.

**³³** But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, nor ever betray My faithfulness.

**³⁴** I will not violate My covenant or alter the utterance of My lips.

**³⁵** Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness— I will not lie to David—

**³⁶** his offspring shall endure forever, and his throne before Me like the sun,

**³⁷** like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah

**³⁸** Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; You are enraged by Your anointed one.

**³⁹** You have renounced the covenant with Your servant and sullied his crown in the dust.

**⁴⁰** You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his strongholds to rubble.

**⁴¹** All who pass by plunder him; he has become a reproach to his neighbors.

**⁴²** You have exalted the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice.

**⁴³** You have bent the edge of his sword and have not sustained him in battle.

**⁴⁴** You have ended his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.

**⁴⁵** You have cut short the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah

**⁴⁶** How long, O LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath keep burning like fire?

**⁴⁷** Remember the briefness of my lifespan! For what futility You have created all men!

**⁴⁸** What man can live and never see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah

**⁴⁹** Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old, which You faithfully swore to David?

**⁵⁰** Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, which I bear in my heart from so many people—

**⁵¹** how Your enemies have taunted, O LORD, and have mocked every step of Your anointed one!

**⁵²** Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and amen.
