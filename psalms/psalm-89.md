# Psalm 89

<sup>1</sup> A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the loving devotion of the LORD forever; with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> For I have said, “Loving devotion is built up forever; in the heavens You establish Your faithfulness.” 

<sup>3</sup> You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant: 

<sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’” 

<sup>5</sup> The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD— Your faithfulness as well— in the assembly of the holy ones. 

<sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD? 

<sup>7</sup> In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared, and awesome above all who surround Him. 

<sup>8</sup> O LORD God of Hosts, who is like You? O mighty LORD, Your faithfulness surrounds You. 

<sup>9</sup> You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them. 

<sup>10</sup> You crushed Rahab like a carcass; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm. 

<sup>11</sup> The heavens are Yours, and also the earth. The earth and its fullness You founded. 

<sup>12</sup> North and south You created; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name. 

<sup>13</sup> Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand. Your right hand is exalted. 

<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; loving devotion and faithfulness go before You. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are those who know the joyful sound, who walk, O LORD, in the light of Your presence. 

<sup>16</sup> They rejoice in Your name all day long, and in Your righteousness they exult. 

<sup>17</sup> For You are the glory of their strength, and by Your favor our horn is exalted. 

<sup>18</sup> Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>19</sup> You once spoke in a vision; to Your godly ones You said, “I have bestowed help on a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 

<sup>20</sup> I have found My servant David; with My sacred oil I have anointed him. 

<sup>21</sup> My hand will sustain him; surely My arm will strengthen him. 

<sup>22</sup> No enemy will exact tribute; no wicked man will oppress him. 

<sup>23</sup> I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him. 

<sup>24</sup> My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted. 

<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand upon the rivers. 

<sup>26</sup> He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation.’ 

<sup>27</sup> I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 

<sup>28</sup> I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, and My covenant with him will stand fast. 

<sup>29</sup> I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure. 

<sup>30</sup> If his sons forsake My law and do not walk in My judgments, 

<sup>31</sup> if they violate My statutes and fail to keep My commandments, 

<sup>32</sup> I will attend to their transgression with the rod, and to their iniquity with stripes. 

<sup>33</sup> But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, nor ever betray My faithfulness. 

<sup>34</sup> I will not violate My covenant or alter the utterance of My lips. 

<sup>35</sup> Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness— I will not lie to David— 

<sup>36</sup> his offspring shall endure forever, and his throne before Me like the sun, 

<sup>37</sup> like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” 

<sup>38</sup> Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; You are enraged by Your anointed one. 

<sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant with Your servant and sullied his crown in the dust. 

<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his strongholds to rubble. 

<sup>41</sup> All who pass by plunder him; he has become a reproach to his neighbors. 

<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice. 

<sup>43</sup> You have bent the edge of his sword and have not sustained him in battle. 

<sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor and cast his throne to the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> You have cut short the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. 

<sup>46</sup> How long, O LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath keep burning like fire? 

<sup>47</sup> Remember the briefness of my lifespan! For what futility You have created all men! 

<sup>48</sup> What man can live and never see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? 

<sup>49</sup> Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old, which You faithfully swore to David? 

<sup>50</sup> Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, which I bear in my heart from so many people— 

<sup>51</sup> how Your enemies have taunted, O LORD, and have mocked every step of Your anointed one! 

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and amen.
