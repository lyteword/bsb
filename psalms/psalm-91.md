# Psalm 91

## You Are My Refuge and My Fortress

**¹** He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.[^2340]

**²** I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”

**³** Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly plague.

**⁴** He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.

**⁵** You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,

**⁶** nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the calamity that destroys at noon.

**⁷** Though a thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, no harm will come near you.

**⁸** You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.

**⁹** Because you have made the LORD your dwelling— my refuge, the Most High—

**¹⁰** no evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent.

**¹¹** For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.

**¹²** They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.[^2341]

**¹³** You will tread on the lion and cobra; you will trample the young lion and serpent.

**¹⁴** “Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him.

**¹⁵** When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him.

**¹⁶** With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
