# Psalm 91

## You Are My Refuge and My Fortress

<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.[^2340]

<sup>2</sup> I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”

<sup>3</sup> Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly plague.

<sup>4</sup> He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.

<sup>5</sup> You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,

<sup>6</sup> nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the calamity that destroys at noon.

<sup>7</sup> Though a thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, no harm will come near you.

<sup>8</sup> You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.

<sup>9</sup> Because you have made the LORD your dwelling— my refuge, the Most High—

<sup>10</sup> no evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent.

<sup>11</sup> For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.

<sup>12</sup> They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.[^2341]

<sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra; you will trample the young lion and serpent.

<sup>14</sup> “Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him.

<sup>15</sup> When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him.

<sup>16</sup> With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
