# Psalm 26

## Vindicate Me, O LORD

Of David.

**¹** Vindicate me, O LORD! For I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.

**²** Test me, O LORD, and try me; examine my heart [^2198] and mind.

**³** For Your loving devotion is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.

**⁴** I do not sit with deceitful men, nor keep company with hypocrites.

**⁵** I hate the mob of evildoers, and refuse to sit with the wicked.

**⁶** I wash my hands in innocence that I may go about Your altar, O LORD,

**⁷** to raise my voice in thanksgiving and declare all Your wonderful works.

**⁸** O LORD, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.

**⁹** Do not take my soul away with sinners, or my life with men of bloodshed,

**¹⁰** in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.

**¹¹** But I will walk with integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.

**¹²** My feet stand on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
