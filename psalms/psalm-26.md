# Psalm 26

## Vindicate Me, O LORD

Of David.

<sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, O LORD! For I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.

<sup>2</sup> Test me, O LORD, and try me; examine my heart [^2198] and mind.

<sup>3</sup> For Your loving devotion is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.

<sup>4</sup> I do not sit with deceitful men, nor keep company with hypocrites.

<sup>5</sup> I hate the mob of evildoers, and refuse to sit with the wicked.

<sup>6</sup> I wash my hands in innocence that I may go about Your altar, O LORD,

<sup>7</sup> to raise my voice in thanksgiving and declare all Your wonderful works.

<sup>8</sup> O LORD, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.

<sup>9</sup> Do not take my soul away with sinners, or my life with men of bloodshed,

<sup>10</sup> in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.

<sup>11</sup> But I will walk with integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.

<sup>12</sup> My feet stand on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
