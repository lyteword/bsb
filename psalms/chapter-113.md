# Chapter 113

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Give praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore. 

<sup>3</sup> From where the sun rises to where it sets, the name of the LORD is praised. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> Who is like the LORD our God, the One enthroned on high? 

<sup>6</sup> He humbles Himself to behold the heavens and the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the dump 

<sup>8</sup> to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people. 

<sup>9</sup> He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother to her children. Hallelujah!
