# Psalm 39

## I Will Watch My Ways

For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> I said, “I will watch my ways so that I will not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are present.”

<sup>2</sup> I was speechless and still; I remained silent, even from speaking good, and my sorrow was stirred.

<sup>3</sup> My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:

<sup>4</sup> “Show me, O LORD, my end and the measure of my days. Let me know how fleeting my life is.

<sup>5</sup> You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths, and my lifetime as nothing before You. Truly each man at his best exists as but a breath. Selah

<sup>6</sup> Surely every man goes about like a phantom; surely he bustles in vain; he heaps up riches not knowing who will haul them away.

<sup>7</sup> And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.

<sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the reproach of fools.

<sup>9</sup> I have become mute; I do not open my mouth because of what You have done.

<sup>10</sup> Remove Your scourge from me; I am perishing by the force of Your hand.

<sup>11</sup> You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity, consuming like a moth what he holds dear; surely each man is but a vapor. Selah

<sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. For I am a foreigner dwelling with You, a stranger like all my fathers.

<sup>13</sup> Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may again be cheered before I depart and am no more.”
