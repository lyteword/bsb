# Psalm 116

## The LORD Has Heard My Voice

**¹** I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice— my appeal for mercy.

**²** Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live.

**³** The ropes of death entangled me; the anguish of Sheol overcame me; I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.

**⁴** Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, deliver my soul!”

**⁵** The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.

**⁶** The LORD preserves the simplehearted; I was helpless, and He saved me.

**⁷** Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you.

**⁸** For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.

**⁹** I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

**¹⁰** I believed, therefore I said,[^2386] “I am greatly afflicted.”

**¹¹** In my alarm I said, “All men are liars!”

**¹²** How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?

**¹³** I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.

**¹⁴** I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people.

**¹⁵** Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.

**¹⁶** Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have broken my bonds.

**¹⁷** I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.

**¹⁸** I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people,

**¹⁹** in the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah![^2387]

[^2386]: 116:10 LXX therefore I have spoken; cited in 2 Corinthians 4:13
[^2387]: 116:19 Or Hallelu YAH, meaning Praise the LORD
