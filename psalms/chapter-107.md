# Chapter 107

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy 

<sup>3</sup> and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. 

<sup>4</sup> Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell. 

<sup>5</sup> They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them. 

<sup>6</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress. 

<sup>7</sup> He led them on a straight path to reach a city where they could live. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men. 

<sup>9</sup> For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. 

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains, 

<sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High. 

<sup>12</sup> He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. 

<sup>13</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress. 

<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men. 

<sup>16</sup> For He has broken down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron. 

<sup>17</sup> Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction. 

<sup>18</sup> They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress. 

<sup>20</sup> He sent forth His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit. 

<sup>21</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men. 

<sup>22</sup> Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing. 

<sup>23</sup> Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters. 

<sup>24</sup> They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea. 

<sup>26</sup> They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish. 

<sup>27</sup> They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless. 

<sup>28</sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress. 

<sup>29</sup> He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed. 

<sup>30</sup> They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired. 

<sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground, 

<sup>34</sup> and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers. 

<sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs. 

<sup>36</sup> He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell. 

<sup>37</sup> They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest. 

<sup>38</sup> He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish. 

<sup>39</sup> When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow, 

<sup>40</sup> He pours out contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland. 

<sup>41</sup> But He lifts the needy from affliction and increases their families like flocks. 

<sup>42</sup> The upright see and rejoice, and all iniquity shuts its mouth. 

<sup>43</sup> Let him who is wise pay heed to these things and consider the loving devotion of the LORD.
