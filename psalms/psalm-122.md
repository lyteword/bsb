# Psalm 122

## Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem

A song of ascents. Of David.

**¹** I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”

**²** Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.

**³** Jerusalem is built up as a city united together,

**⁴** where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.

**⁵** For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.

**⁶** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper.[^2404]

**⁷** May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity [^2405] inside your fortresses.”

**⁸** For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”

**⁹** For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.

[^2404]: 122:6 Or be secure
[^2405]: 122:7 Or security
