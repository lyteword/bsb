# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD.” 

<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built up as a city united together, 

<sup>4</sup> where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David. 

<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper. 

<sup>7</sup> May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity inside your fortresses.” 

<sup>8</sup> For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.” 

<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
