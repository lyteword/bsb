# Chapter 115

<sup>1</sup> Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness. 

<sup>2</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” 

<sup>3</sup> Our God is in heaven; He does as He pleases. 

<sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men. 

<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see; 

<sup>6</sup> they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell; 

<sup>7</sup> they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even clear their throats. 

<sup>8</sup> Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them. 

<sup>9</sup> O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 

<sup>10</sup> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 

<sup>11</sup> You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield. 

<sup>12</sup> The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron; 

<sup>13</sup> He will bless those who fear the LORD— small and great alike. 

<sup>14</sup> May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children. 

<sup>15</sup> May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 

<sup>16</sup> The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind. 

<sup>17</sup> It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence. 

<sup>18</sup> But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah!
