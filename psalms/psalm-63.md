# Psalm 63

## Thirsting for God

**(2 Samuel 15:30–37)**

A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.

**¹** O God, You are my God. Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You. My body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.

**²** So I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and glory.

**³** Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.

**⁴** So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.

**⁵** My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.

**⁶** When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.

**⁷** For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.

**⁸** My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.

**⁹** But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.

**¹⁰** They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become a portion for foxes.

**¹¹** But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
