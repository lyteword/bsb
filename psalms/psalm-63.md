# Psalm 63

## Thirsting for God

**(2 Samuel 15:30–37)**

A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.

<sup>1</sup> O God, You are my God. Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You. My body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.

<sup>2</sup> So I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and glory.

<sup>3</sup> Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.

<sup>4</sup> So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.

<sup>5</sup> My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.

<sup>6</sup> When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.

<sup>7</sup> For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.

<sup>8</sup> My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.

<sup>9</sup> But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.

<sup>10</sup> They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become a portion for foxes.

<sup>11</sup> But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
