# Chapter 139

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O LORD, You have searched me and known me. 

<sup>2</sup> You know when I sit and when I rise; You understand my thoughts from afar. 

<sup>3</sup> You search out my path and my lying down; You are aware of all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, O LORD. 

<sup>5</sup> You hem me in behind and before; You have laid Your hand upon me. 

<sup>6</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. 

<sup>7</sup> Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence? 

<sup>8</sup> If I ascend to the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there. 

<sup>9</sup> If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle by the farthest sea, 

<sup>10</sup> even there Your hand will guide me; Your right hand will hold me fast. 

<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light become night around me”— 

<sup>12</sup> even the darkness is not dark to You, but the night shines like the day, for darkness is as light to You. 

<sup>13</sup> For You formed my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb. 

<sup>14</sup> I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are Your works, and I know this very well. 

<sup>15</sup> My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in Your book and ordained for me before one of them came to be. 

<sup>17</sup> How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God, how vast is their sum! 

<sup>18</sup> If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; and when I awake, I am still with You. 

<sup>19</sup> O God, that You would slay the wicked— away from me, you bloodthirsty men— 

<sup>20</sup> who speak of You deceitfully; Your enemies take Your name in vain. 

<sup>21</sup> Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD, and detest those who rise against You? 

<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them as my enemies. 

<sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns. 

<sup>24</sup> See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the way everlasting.
