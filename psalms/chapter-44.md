# Chapter 44

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their days, in the days of old. 

<sup>2</sup> With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our fathers there; You crushed the peoples and cast them out. 

<sup>3</sup> For it was not by their sword that they took the land; their arm did not bring them victory. It was by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them. 

<sup>4</sup> You are my King, O God, who ordains victories for Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies. 

<sup>6</sup> For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me. 

<sup>7</sup> For You save us from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame. 

<sup>8</sup> In God we have boasted all day long, and Your name we will praise forever. 

<sup>9</sup> But You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go forth with our armies. 

<sup>10</sup> You have made us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have plundered us. 

<sup>11</sup> You have given us up as sheep to be devoured; You have scattered us among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> You sell Your people for nothing; no profit do You gain from their sale. 

<sup>13</sup> You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us. 

<sup>14</sup> You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face, 

<sup>16</sup> at the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy, bent on revenge. 

<sup>17</sup> All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant. 

<sup>18</sup> Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path. 

<sup>19</sup> But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals; You have covered us with deepest darkness. 

<sup>20</sup> If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, 

<sup>21</sup> would not God have discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart? 

<sup>22</sup> Yet for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. 

<sup>23</sup> Wake up, O Lord! Why are You sleeping? Arise! Do not reject us forever. 

<sup>24</sup> Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and oppression? 

<sup>25</sup> For our soul has sunk to the dust; our bodies cling to the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> Rise up; be our help! Redeem us on account of Your loving devotion.
