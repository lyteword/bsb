# Psalm 86

## Tried but Trusting

A prayer of David.

**¹** Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.

**²** Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.

**³** Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I call to You all day long.

**⁴** Bring joy to Your servant, for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

**⁵** For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.

**⁶** Hear my prayer, O LORD, and attend to my plea for mercy.

**⁷** In the day of my distress I call on You, because You answer me.

**⁸** O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, nor any works like Yours.

**⁹** All the nations You have made will come and bow before You, O Lord, and they will glorify Your name.

**¹⁰** For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.

**¹¹** Teach me Your way, O LORD, that I may walk in Your truth. Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name.

**¹²** I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever.

**¹³** For great is Your loving devotion to me; You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.

**¹⁴** The arrogant rise against me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life; they have no regard for You.

**¹⁵** But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness.

**¹⁶** Turn to me and have mercy; grant Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your maidservant.

**¹⁷** Show me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see and be ashamed; for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
