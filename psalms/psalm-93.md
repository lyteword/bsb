# Psalm 93

## The LORD Reigns!

**(Psalms 99:1–9)**

**¹** The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved.

**²** Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity.

**³** The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves.

**⁴** Above the roar of many waters— the mighty breakers of the sea— the LORD on high is majestic.

**⁵** Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
