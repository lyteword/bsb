# Psalm 101

## I Will Set No Worthless Thing before My Eyes

A Psalm of David.

**¹** I will sing of Your loving devotion and justice; to You, O LORD, I will sing praises.

**²** I will ponder the way that is blameless— when will You come to me? I will walk in my house with integrity of heart.

**³** I will set no worthless thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.

**⁴** A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know nothing of evil.

**⁵** Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not endure.

**⁶** My eyes favor the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way of integrity shall minister to me.

**⁷** No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who tells lies shall stand in my presence.

**⁸** Every morning I will remove all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
