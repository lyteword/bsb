# Chapter 76

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A song. God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> His tent is in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> There He shattered the flaming arrows, the shield and sword and weapons of war. 

<sup>4</sup> You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains filled with game. 

<sup>5</sup> The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand. 

<sup>6</sup> At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned. 

<sup>7</sup> You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You? 

<sup>8</sup> From heaven You pronounced judgment, and the earth feared and was still 

<sup>9</sup> when God rose up to judge, to save all the lowly of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Even the wrath of man shall praise You; with the survivors of wrath You will clothe Yourself. 

<sup>11</sup> Make and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God; let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him who is to be feared. 

<sup>12</sup> He breaks the spirits of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
