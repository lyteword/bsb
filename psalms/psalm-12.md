# Psalm 12

## The Godly Are No More

For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith.[^2162] A Psalm of David.

**¹** Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.

**²** They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.

**³** May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue.

**⁴** They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lips—who can be our master?”

**⁵** “For the cause of the oppressed and for the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the LORD. “I will bring safety to him who yearns.”

**⁶** The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold.[^2163]

**⁷** You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation.

**⁸** The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.

[^2162]: 12:0 Sheminith is probably a musical term; here and in 1 Chronicles 15:21 and Psalms 6:1.
[^2163]: 12:6 Probable reading; MT like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified sevenfold
