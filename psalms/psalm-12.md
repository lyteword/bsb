# Psalm 12

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men. 

<sup>2</sup> They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart. 

<sup>3</sup> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue. 

<sup>4</sup> They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lips—who can be our master?” 

<sup>5</sup> “For the cause of the oppressed and for the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the LORD. “I will bring safety to him who yearns.” 

<sup>6</sup> The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold. 

<sup>7</sup> You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation. 

<sup>8</sup> The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.
