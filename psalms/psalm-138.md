# Psalm 138

<sup>1</sup> Of David. I give You thanks with all my heart; before the gods I sing Your praises. 

<sup>2</sup> I bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness; You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else. 

<sup>3</sup> On the day I called, You answered me; You emboldened me and strengthened my soul. 

<sup>4</sup> All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> They will sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great. 

<sup>6</sup> Though the LORD is on high, He attends to the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar. 

<sup>7</sup> If I walk in the midst of trouble, You preserve me from the anger of my foes; You extend Your hand, and Your right hand saves me. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD will fulfill His purpose for me. O LORD, Your loving devotion endures foreverâ€” do not abandon the works of Your hands.
