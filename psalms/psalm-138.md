# Psalm 138

## A Thankful Heart

Of David.

**¹** I give You thanks with all my heart; before the gods I sing Your praises.

**²** I bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness; You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else.

**³** On the day I called, You answered me; You emboldened me and strengthened my soul.[^2417]

**⁴** All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth.

**⁵** They will sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great.

**⁶** Though the LORD is on high, He attends to the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar.

**⁷** If I walk in the midst of trouble, You preserve me from the anger of my foes; You extend Your hand, and Your right hand saves me.

**⁸** The LORD will fulfill His purpose for me. O LORD, Your loving devotion endures forever— do not abandon the works of Your hands.

[^2417]: 138:3 Or You emboldened me with strength in my soul
