# Psalm 82

## God Presides in the Divine Assembly

A Psalm of Asaph.

<sup>1</sup> God presides in the divine assembly; He renders judgment among the gods:

<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly [^2323] and show partiality to the wicked? Selah

<sup>3</sup> Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.

<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.

<sup>5</sup> They do not know or understand; they wander in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.

<sup>6</sup> I have said, ‘You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.’[^2324]

<sup>7</sup> But like mortals you will die, and like rulers you will fall.”

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are Your inheritance.

[^2323]: 82:2 Or How long will you defend the unjust
[^2324]: 82:6 Cited in John 10:34
