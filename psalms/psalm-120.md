# Psalm 120

## In My Distress I Cried to the LORD

A song of ascents.

**¹** In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.

**²** Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.

**³** What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?

**⁴** Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree!

**⁵** Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!

**⁶** Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.

**⁷** I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
