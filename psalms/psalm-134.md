# Psalm 134

## Bless the LORD, All You Servants

A song of ascents.

<sup>1</sup> Come, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD who serve by night in the house of the LORD!

<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands to the sanctuary and bless the LORD!

<sup>3</sup> May the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
