# Psalm 74

## Why Have You Rejected Us Forever?

**(Psalms 79:1–13; Jeremiah 52:1–11)**

A Maskil [^2303] of Asaph.

<sup>1</sup> Why have You rejected us forever, O God? Why does Your anger smolder against the sheep of Your pasture?

<sup>2</sup> Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance— Mount Zion, where You dwell.

<sup>3</sup> Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.

<sup>4</sup> Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,

<sup>5</sup> like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees

<sup>6</sup> and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.

<sup>7</sup> They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name.

<sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely.” They burned down every place where God met us in the land.

<sup>9</sup> There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.

<sup>10</sup> How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?

<sup>11</sup> Why do You withdraw Your strong right hand? Stretch it out to destroy them![^2304]

<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King from ancient times, working salvation on the earth.

<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by Your strength; You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea;

<sup>14</sup> You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.

<sup>15</sup> You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.

<sup>16</sup> The day is Yours, and also the night; You established the moon [^2305] and the sun.

<sup>17</sup> You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made the summer and winter.

<sup>18</sup> Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD, how a foolish people has spurned Your name.

<sup>19</sup> Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.

<sup>20</sup> Consider Your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.

<sup>21</sup> Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; may the poor and needy praise Your name.

<sup>22</sup> Rise up, O God; defend Your cause! Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.

<sup>23</sup> Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually.
