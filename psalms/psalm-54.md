# Psalm 54

## Save Me by Your Name

**(1 Samuel 23:7–29)**

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil [^2264] of David. When the Ziphites went to Saul and said, “Is David not hiding among us?”

<sup>1</sup> Save me, O God, by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might!

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.

<sup>3</sup> For strangers rise up against me, and ruthless men seek my life— men with no regard for God. Selah

<sup>4</sup> Surely God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my soul.

<sup>5</sup> He will reward my enemies with evil. In Your faithfulness, destroy them.

<sup>6</sup> Freely I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good.

<sup>7</sup> For He has delivered me from every trouble, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.

[^2264]: 54:0 Maskil is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 32, 42, 44–45, 52–55, 74, 78, 88–89, and 142.
