# Psalm 44

## Redeem Us, O God

**(Romans 8:35–39)**

For the choirmaster. A Maskil [^2235] of the sons of Korah.

**¹** We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their days, in the days of old.

**²** With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our fathers there; You crushed the peoples and cast them out.

**³** For it was not by their sword that they took the land; their arm did not bring them victory. It was by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.

**⁴** You are my King, O God, who ordains victories for Jacob.

**⁵** Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.

**⁶** For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me.[^2236]

**⁷** For You save us from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame.

**⁸** In God we have boasted all day long, and Your name we will praise forever. Selah

**⁹** But You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go forth with our armies.

**¹⁰** You have made us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have plundered us.

**¹¹** You have given us up as sheep to be devoured; You have scattered us among the nations.

**¹²** You sell Your people for nothing; no profit do You gain from their sale.

**¹³** You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us.

**¹⁴** You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock [^2237] among the peoples.

**¹⁵** All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face,

**¹⁶** at the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy, bent on revenge.

**¹⁷** All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.

**¹⁸** Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.

**¹⁹** But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals;[^2238] You have covered us with deepest darkness.

**²⁰** If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,

**²¹** would not God have discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart?

**²²** Yet for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.[^2239]

**²³** Wake up, O Lord! Why are You sleeping? Arise! Do not reject us forever.

**²⁴** Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and oppression?

**²⁵** For our soul has sunk to the dust; our bodies cling to the earth.

**²⁶** Rise up; be our help! Redeem us on account of Your loving devotion.
