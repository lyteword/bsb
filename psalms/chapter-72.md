# Chapter 72

<sup>1</sup> Of Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice. 

<sup>3</sup> May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor. 

<sup>5</sup> May they fear him as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more. 

<sup>8</sup> May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts. 

<sup>11</sup> May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him. 

<sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> He will take pity on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed. 

<sup>14</sup> He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight. 

<sup>15</sup> Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long. 

<sup>16</sup> May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, and its people like the grass of the field. 

<sup>17</sup> May his name endure forever; may his name continue as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed. 

<sup>18</sup> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds. 

<sup>19</sup> And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen. 

<sup>20</sup> Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.
