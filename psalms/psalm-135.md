# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD, 

<sup>2</sup> who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 

<sup>3</sup> Hallelujah, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely. 

<sup>4</sup> For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession. 

<sup>5</sup> For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD does all that pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all their depths. 

<sup>7</sup> He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He generates the lightning with the rain and brings forth the wind from His storehouses. 

<sup>8</sup> He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast. 

<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. 

<sup>10</sup> He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings: 

<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan. 

<sup>12</sup> He gave their land as an inheritance, as a heritage to His people Israel. 

<sup>13</sup> Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants. 

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men. 

<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see; 

<sup>17</sup> they have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them. 

<sup>19</sup> O house of Israel, bless the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless the LORD; 

<sup>20</sup> O house of Levi, bless the LORD; you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD! 

<sup>21</sup> Blessed be the LORD from Zionâ€” He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
