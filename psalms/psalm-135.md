# Psalm 135

## Give Praise, O Servants of the LORD

**(Psalms 115:1–18)**

**¹** Hallelujah![^2412] Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD,

**²** who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.

**³** Hallelujah, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.

**⁴** For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession.

**⁵** For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.

**⁶** The LORD does all that pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all their depths.

**⁷** He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He generates the lightning with the rain and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.

**⁸** He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.

**⁹** He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.

**¹⁰** He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:

**¹¹** Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.

**¹²** He gave their land as an inheritance, as a heritage to His people Israel.

**¹³** Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations.

**¹⁴** For the LORD will vindicate His people [^2413] and will have compassion on His servants.

**¹⁵** The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.

**¹⁶** They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;

**¹⁷** they have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there breath in their mouths.

**¹⁸** Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.

**¹⁹** O house of Israel, bless the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless the LORD;

**²⁰** O house of Levi, bless the LORD; you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD!

**²¹** Blessed be the LORD from Zion— He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
