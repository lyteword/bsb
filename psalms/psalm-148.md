## Praise the LORD from the Heavens

**(Psalms 33:1–22)**

**¹** Hallelujah![^2433] Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places.[^2434]

**²** Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.

**³** Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars.

**⁴** Praise Him, O highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.

**⁵** Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created.

**⁶** He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.

**⁷** Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths,

**⁸** lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word,

**⁹** mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,

**¹⁰** wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds,

**¹¹** kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth,

**¹²** young men and maidens, old and young together.

**¹³** Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens.

**¹⁴** He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
