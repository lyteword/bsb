# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts. 

<sup>3</sup> Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars. 

<sup>4</sup> Praise Him, O highest heavens, and you waters above the skies. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created. 

<sup>6</sup> He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away. 

<sup>7</sup> Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths, 

<sup>8</sup> lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word, 

<sup>9</sup> mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, 

<sup>10</sup> wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds, 

<sup>11</sup> kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth, 

<sup>12</sup> young men and maidens, old and young together. 

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens. 

<sup>14</sup> He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
