# Psalm 148

## Praise the LORD from the Heavens

**(Psalms 33:1–22)**

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah![^2433] Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places.[^2434]

<sup>2</sup> Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.

<sup>3</sup> Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars.

<sup>4</sup> Praise Him, O highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.

<sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created.

<sup>6</sup> He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.

<sup>7</sup> Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths,

<sup>8</sup> lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word,

<sup>9</sup> mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,

<sup>10</sup> wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds,

<sup>11</sup> kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth,

<sup>12</sup> young men and maidens, old and young together.

<sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens.

<sup>14</sup> He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
