# Psalm 85

## You Showed Favor to Your Land

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

**¹** You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity.[^2329]

**²** You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah

**³** You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.

**⁴** Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us.

**⁵** Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?

**⁶** Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?

**⁷** Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.

**⁸** I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly.

**⁹** Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land.

**¹⁰** Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed.

**¹¹** Faithfulness sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.

**¹²** The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase.

**¹³** Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.

[^2329]: 85:1 Or restored the fortunes of Jacob
