# Psalm 40

## I Waited Patiently for the LORD

**(Psalms 70:1–5; Hebrews 10:1–18)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** I waited patiently for the LORD; He inclined to me and heard my cry.

**²** He lifted me up from the pit of despair, out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.

**³** He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.

**⁴** Blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, who has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.[^2229]

**⁵** Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders You have done, and the plans You have for us— none can compare to You— if I proclaim and declare them, they are more than I can count.

**⁶** Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened.[^2230] Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.

**⁷** Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll:

**⁸** I delight to do Your will, O my God;[^2231] Your law is within my heart.”

**⁹** I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; behold, I do not seal my lips, as You, O LORD, do know.

**¹⁰** I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation; I have not concealed Your loving devotion and faithfulness from the great assembly.

**¹¹** O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me; Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me.

**¹²** For evils without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed within me.

**¹³** Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; hurry, O LORD, to help me.

**¹⁴** May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.

**¹⁵** May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” be appalled at their own shame.

**¹⁶** May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “The LORD be magnified!”

**¹⁷** But I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my helper and deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
