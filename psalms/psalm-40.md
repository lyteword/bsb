# Psalm 40

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; He inclined to me and heard my cry. 

<sup>2</sup> He lifted me up from the pit of despair, out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm. 

<sup>3</sup> He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, who has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood. 

<sup>5</sup> Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders You have done, and the plans You have for us— none can compare to You— if I proclaim and declare them, they are more than I can count. 

<sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened. Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require. 

<sup>7</sup> Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll: 

<sup>8</sup> I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your law is within my heart.” 

<sup>9</sup> I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; behold, I do not seal my lips, as You, O LORD, do know. 

<sup>10</sup> I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation; I have not concealed Your loving devotion and faithfulness from the great assembly. 

<sup>11</sup> O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me; Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me. 

<sup>12</sup> For evils without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed within me. 

<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; hurry, O LORD, to help me. 

<sup>14</sup> May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated. 

<sup>15</sup> May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” be appalled at their own shame. 

<sup>16</sup> May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “The LORD be magnified!” 

<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my helper and deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
