# Psalm 71

## Be My Rock of Refuge

<sup>1</sup> In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.

<sup>2</sup> In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; incline Your ear and save me.

<sup>3</sup> Be my rock of refuge, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for You are my rock and my fortress.

<sup>4</sup> Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and ruthless.

<sup>5</sup> For You are my hope, O Lord GOD, my confidence from my youth.

<sup>6</sup> I have leaned on You since birth; You pulled me from my mother’s womb. My praise is always for You.

<sup>7</sup> I have become a portent to many, but You are my strong refuge.

<sup>8</sup> My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your splendor all day long.

<sup>9</sup> Do not discard me in my old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails.

<sup>10</sup> For my enemies speak against me, and those who lie in wait for my life conspire,

<sup>11</sup> saying, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for there is no one to rescue him.”

<sup>12</sup> Be not far from me, O God. Hurry, O my God, to help me.

<sup>13</sup> May the accusers of my soul be ashamed and consumed; may those who seek my harm be covered with scorn and disgrace.

<sup>14</sup> But I will always hope and will praise You more and more.

<sup>15</sup> My mouth will declare Your righteousness and Your salvation all day long, though I cannot know their full measure.

<sup>16</sup> I will come in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will proclaim Your righteousness—Yours alone.

<sup>17</sup> O God, You have taught me from my youth, and to this day I proclaim Your marvelous deeds.

<sup>18</sup> Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, until I proclaim Your power to the next generation, Your might to all who are to come.

<sup>19</sup> Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God, You who have done great things. Who, O God, is like You?

<sup>20</sup> Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes, You will revive me once again. Even from the depths of the earth You will bring me back up.

<sup>21</sup> You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.

<sup>22</sup> So I will praise You with the harp for Your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to You with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.

<sup>23</sup> When I sing praise to You my lips will shout for joy, along with my soul, which You have redeemed.

<sup>24</sup> My tongue will indeed proclaim Your righteousness all day long, for those who seek my harm are disgraced and confounded.
