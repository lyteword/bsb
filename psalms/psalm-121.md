# Psalm 121

## I Lift Up My Eyes to the Hills

A song of ascents.

**¹** I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come?

**²** My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.

**³** He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber.

**⁴** Behold, the Protector of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.

**⁵** The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand.

**⁶** The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.

**⁷** The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul.

**⁸** The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
