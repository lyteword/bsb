# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? 

<sup>2</sup> My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, the Protector of Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
