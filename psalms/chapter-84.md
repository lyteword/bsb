# Chapter 84

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How lovely is Your dwelling place, O LORD of Hosts! 

<sup>2</sup> My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 

<sup>3</sup> Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she places her young near Your altars, O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God. 

<sup>4</sup> How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 

<sup>6</sup> As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools. 

<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion. 

<sup>8</sup> O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. 

<sup>9</sup> Take notice of our shield, O God, and look with favor on the face of Your anointed. 

<sup>10</sup> For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity. 

<sup>12</sup> O LORD of Hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in You!
