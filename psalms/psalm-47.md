# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout unto God with a voice of triumph. 

<sup>2</sup> How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth! 

<sup>3</sup> He subdues nations beneath us, and peoples under our feet. 

<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. 

<sup>5</sup> God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD with the sound of the horn. 

<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises! 

<sup>7</sup> For God is King of all the earth; sing profound praises to Him. 

<sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne. 

<sup>9</sup> The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.
