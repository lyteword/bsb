# Psalm 47

## Clap Your Hands, All You Peoples

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

**¹** Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout unto God with a voice of triumph.

**²** How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth!

**³** He subdues nations beneath us, and peoples under our feet.

**⁴** He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah

**⁵** God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD with the sound of the horn.

**⁶** Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises!

**⁷** For God is King of all the earth; sing to Him a psalm of praise.[^2245]

**⁸** God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.

**⁹** The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.

[^2245]: 47:7 Or sing a Maskil of praise or sing praises with understanding
