# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> Of David. Do not fret over those who do evil; do not envy those who do wrong. 

<sup>2</sup> For they wither quickly like grass and wilt like tender plants. 

<sup>3</sup> Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> Delight yourself in the LORD, and He will give you the desires of your heart. 

<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do it. 

<sup>6</sup> He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn, your justice like the noonday sun. 

<sup>7</sup> Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him; do not fret when men prosper in their ways, when they carry out wicked schemes. 

<sup>8</sup> Refrain from anger and abandon wrath; do not fretâ€”it can only bring harm. 

<sup>9</sup> For the evildoers will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. 

<sup>10</sup> Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. 

<sup>11</sup> But the meek will inherit the land and delight in abundant prosperity. 

<sup>12</sup> The wicked scheme against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them, 

<sup>13</sup> but the Lord laughs, seeing that their day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn the sword and bent the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright. 

<sup>15</sup> But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many who are wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will last forever. 

<sup>19</sup> In the time of evil they will not be ashamed, and in the days of famine they will be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked and enemies of the LORD will perish like the glory of the fields. They will vanish; like smoke they will fade away. 

<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous are gracious and giving. 

<sup>22</sup> Surely those He blesses will inherit the land, but the cursed will be destroyed. 

<sup>23</sup> The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD who takes delight in his journey. 

<sup>24</sup> Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, for the LORD is holding his hand. 

<sup>25</sup> I once was young and now am old, yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned or their children begging for bread. 

<sup>26</sup> They are ever generous and quick to lend, and their children are a blessing. 

<sup>27</sup> Turn away from evil and do good, so that you will abide forever. 

<sup>28</sup> For the LORD loves justice and will not forsake His saints. They are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. 

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. 

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter. 

<sup>32</sup> Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous, and seek to slay them, 

<sup>33</sup> the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned under judgment. 

<sup>34</sup> Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will raise you up to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you will see it. 

<sup>35</sup> I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a well-rooted native tree, 

<sup>36</sup> yet he passed away and was no more; though I searched, he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> Consider the blameless and observe the upright, for posterity awaits the man of peace. 

<sup>38</sup> But the transgressors will all be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their stronghold in time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> The LORD helps and delivers them; He rescues and saves them from the wicked, because they take refuge in Him.
