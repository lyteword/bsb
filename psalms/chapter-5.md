# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning. 

<sup>2</sup> Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray. 

<sup>3</sup> In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation. 

<sup>4</sup> For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You. 

<sup>5</sup> The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity. 

<sup>6</sup> You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit. 

<sup>7</sup> But I will enter Your house by the abundance of Your loving devotion; in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me. 

<sup>9</sup> For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction lies within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit. 

<sup>10</sup> Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You. 

<sup>11</sup> But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You. 

<sup>12</sup> For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of Your favor.
