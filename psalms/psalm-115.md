# Psalm 115

## To Your Name Be the Glory

**(Psalms 135:1–21)**

**¹** Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.

**²** Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”

**³** Our God is in heaven; He does as He pleases.

**⁴** Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.

**⁵** They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;

**⁶** they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;

**⁷** they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even clear their throats.[^2383]

**⁸** Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.

**⁹** O Israel,[^2384] trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

**¹⁰** O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

**¹¹** You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

**¹²** The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;

**¹³** He will bless those who fear the LORD— small and great alike.

**¹⁴** May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.

**¹⁵** May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.

**¹⁶** The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind.

**¹⁷** It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence.

**¹⁸** But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah![^2385]
