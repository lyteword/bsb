# Psalm 90

<sup>1</sup> A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, You have been our dwelling place through all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God. 

<sup>3</sup> You return man to dust, saying, “Return, O sons of mortals.” 

<sup>4</sup> For in Your sight a thousand years are but a day that passes, or a watch of the night. 

<sup>5</sup> You whisk them away in their sleep; they are like the new grass of the morning— 

<sup>6</sup> in the morning it springs up new, but by evening it fades and withers. 

<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed by Your anger and terrified by Your wrath. 

<sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence. 

<sup>9</sup> For all our days decline in Your fury; we finish our years with a sigh. 

<sup>10</sup> The length of our days is seventy years— or eighty if we are strong— yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. 

<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear You are due. 

<sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days, that we may present a heart of wisdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Return, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on Your servants. 

<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 

<sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil. 

<sup>16</sup> May Your work be shown to Your servants, and Your splendor to their children. 

<sup>17</sup> May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish for us the work of our hands— yes, establish the work of our hands!
