# Psalm 90

## From Everlasting to Everlasting

A prayer of Moses the man of God.

**¹** Lord, You have been our dwelling place through all generations.

**²** Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.

**³** You return man to dust, saying, “Return, O sons of mortals.”

**⁴** For in Your sight a thousand years are but a day that passes,[^2338] or a watch of the night.

**⁵** You sweep them away in their sleep; they are like the new grass of the morning—

**⁶** in the morning it springs up new, but by evening it fades and withers.

**⁷** For we are consumed by Your anger and terrified by Your wrath.

**⁸** You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.

**⁹** For all our days decline in Your fury; we finish our years with a sigh.

**¹⁰** The length of our days is seventy years— or eighty if we are strong— yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.

**¹¹** Who knows the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear You are due.

**¹²** So teach us to number our days, that we may present a heart of wisdom.

**¹³** Return, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on Your servants.

**¹⁴** Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.

**¹⁵** Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.

**¹⁶** May Your work be shown to Your servants, and Your splendor to their children.

**¹⁷** May the favor [^2339] of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish for us the work of our hands— yes, establish the work of our hands!

[^2338]: 90:4 See 2 Peter 3:8.
[^2339]: 90:17 Or beauty
