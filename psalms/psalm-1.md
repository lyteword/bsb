# Psalm 1

## The Two Paths

**(Matthew 5:3–12; Luke 6:20–23)**

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or set foot on the path of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers.

<sup>2</sup> But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.

<sup>3</sup> He is like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither, and who prospers in all he does.

<sup>4</sup> Not so the wicked! For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.

<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
