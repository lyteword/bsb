# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 

<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness. 

<sup>3</sup> The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is heard over many waters. 

<sup>4</sup> The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic. 

<sup>5</sup> The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox. 

<sup>7</sup> The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire. 

<sup>8</sup> The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh. 

<sup>9</sup> The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in His temple all cry, “Glory!” 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD gives His people strength; the LORD blesses His people with peace.
