# Psalm 29

## Ascribe Glory to the LORD

A Psalm of David.

**¹** Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings,[^2200] ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.

**²** Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness.[^2201]

**³** The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is heard over many waters.

**⁴** The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.

**⁵** The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.

**⁶** He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion [^2202] like a young wild ox.

**⁷** The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire.

**⁸** The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh.

**⁹** The voice of the LORD twists the oaks [^2203] and strips the forests bare. And in His temple all cry, “Glory!”

**¹⁰** The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever.

**¹¹** The LORD gives His people strength; the LORD blesses His people with peace.

[^2200]: 29:1 Or sons of God or sons of might
[^2201]: 29:2 Or in holy attire
[^2202]: 29:6 That is, Mount Hermon
[^2203]: 29:9 Or LORD makes the deer to calve
