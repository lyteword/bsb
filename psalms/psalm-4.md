# Psalm 4

## Answer Me When I Call!

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved my distress; show me grace and hear my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies [^2146]? Selah

<sup>3</sup> Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.

<sup>4</sup> Be angry, yet do not sin;[^2147] on your bed, search your heart and be still. Selah

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the LORD.

<sup>6</sup> Many ask, “Who can show us the good?” Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.

<sup>7</sup> You have filled my heart with more joy than when grain and new wine abound.

<sup>8</sup> I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

[^2146]: 4:2 Or false gods
[^2147]: 4:4 Or In your anger do not sin or Tremble and do not sin; cited in Ephesians 4:26
