# Psalm 4

## Answer Me When I Call!

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved my distress; show me grace and hear my prayer.

**²** How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies [^2146]? Selah

**³** Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.

**⁴** Be angry, yet do not sin;[^2147] on your bed, search your heart and be still. Selah

**⁵** Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the LORD.

**⁶** Many ask, “Who can show us the good?” Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.

**⁷** You have filled my heart with more joy than when grain and new wine abound.

**⁸** I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

[^2146]: 4:2 Or false gods
[^2147]: 4:4 Or In your anger do not sin or Tremble and do not sin; cited in Ephesians 4:26
