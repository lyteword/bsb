# Psalm 3

## Deliver Me, O LORD!

**(2 Samuel 15:13–29)**

A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, how my foes have increased! How many rise up against me!

<sup>2</sup> Many say of me, “God will not deliver him.” Selah [^2145]

<sup>3</sup> But You, O LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the One who lifts my head.

<sup>4</sup> To the LORD I cry aloud, and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah

<sup>5</sup> I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.

<sup>6</sup> I will not fear the myriads set against me on every side.

<sup>7</sup> Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.

<sup>8</sup> Salvation belongs to the LORD; may Your blessing be on Your people. Selah

[^2145]: 3:2 Selah or Interlude is probably a musical or literary term; here and throughout the Psalms.
