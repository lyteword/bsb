# Psalm 130

## Out of the Depths

A song of ascents.

**¹** Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD!

**²** O Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.

**³** If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?

**⁴** But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared.

**⁵** I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope.

**⁶** My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning— more than watchmen wait for the morning.

**⁷** O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance.

**⁸** And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.
