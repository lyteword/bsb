# Psalm 9

## I Will Give Thanks to the LORD

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David.[^2158]

**¹** I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.

**²** I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.

**³** When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.

**⁴** For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously.

**⁵** You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.

**⁶** The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished.

**⁷** But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment.

**⁸** He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity.

**⁹** The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.

**¹⁰** Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.

**¹¹** Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.

**¹²** For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.

**¹³** Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Lift me up from the gates of death,

**¹⁴** that I may declare all Your praises— that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.

**¹⁵** The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.

**¹⁶** The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion Selah [^2159]

**¹⁷** The wicked will return to Sheol— all the nations who forget God.

**¹⁸** For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.

**¹⁹** Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.

**²⁰** Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah

[^2158]: 9:0 Psalms 9 and 10 together follow an acrostic pattern, each stanza beginning with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In the LXX they form one psalm.
[^2159]: 9:16 Higgaion Selah or quiet interlude is probably a musical or liturgical term.
