# Chapter 48

<sup>1</sup> A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, His holy mountain. 

<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in loftiness, the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the great King. 

<sup>3</sup> God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself to be a fortress. 

<sup>4</sup> For behold, the kings assembled; they all advanced together. 

<sup>5</sup> They saw and were astounded; they fled in terror. 

<sup>6</sup> Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor. 

<sup>7</sup> With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish. 

<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. 

<sup>9</sup> Within Your temple, O God, we contemplate Your loving devotion. 

<sup>10</sup> Your name, O God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. 

<sup>11</sup> Mount Zion is glad, the daughters of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments. 

<sup>12</sup> March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers, 

<sup>13</sup> consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation. 

<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even till death.
