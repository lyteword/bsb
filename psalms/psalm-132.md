# Psalm 132

## The LORD Has Chosen Zion

A song of ascents.

**¹** O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,

**²** how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

**³** “I will not enter my house or get into my bed,

**⁴** I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,

**⁵** until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.[^2409]”

**⁶** We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah;[^2410] we found it in the fields of Jaar.

**⁷** Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.

**⁸** Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.

**⁹** May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.

**¹⁰** For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.

**¹¹** The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne.[^2411]

**¹²** If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.”

**¹³** For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:

**¹⁴** “This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home.

**¹⁵** I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.

**¹⁶** I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy.

**¹⁷** There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.

**¹⁸** I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam.”
