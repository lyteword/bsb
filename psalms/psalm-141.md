# Psalm 141

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You. 

<sup>2</sup> May my prayer be set before You like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering. 

<sup>3</sup> Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips. 

<sup>4</sup> Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant. 

<sup>7</sup> As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 

<sup>8</sup> But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless. 

<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers. 

<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
