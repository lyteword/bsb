# Psalm 141

## Come Quickly to Me

**(Psalms 70:1–5)**

A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.

<sup>2</sup> May my prayer be set before You like incense; my uplifted hands, like the evening offering.

<sup>3</sup> Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.

<sup>4</sup> Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.

<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.

<sup>6</sup> When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.

<sup>7</sup> As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

<sup>8</sup> But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.[^2422]

<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers.

<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.

[^2422]: 141:8 Or do not pour out my life or do not give me over to death
