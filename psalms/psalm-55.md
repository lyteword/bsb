# Psalm 55

## Cast Your Burden upon the LORD

**(2 Samuel 17:15–29)**

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil [^2265] of David.

**¹** Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea.

**²** Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught

**³** at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they bring down disaster upon me and resent me in their anger.

**⁴** My heart pounds within me, and the terrors of death assail me.

**⁵** Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me.

**⁶** I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.

**⁷** How far away I would flee! In the wilderness I would remain. Selah

**⁸** I would hurry to my shelter, far from this raging tempest.”

**⁹** O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.

**¹⁰** Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within.

**¹¹** Destruction is within; oppression and deceit never leave the streets.

**¹²** For it is not an enemy who insults me; that I could endure. It is not a foe who rises against me; from him I could hide.

**¹³** But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.

**¹⁴** We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.

**¹⁵** Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes.

**¹⁶** But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.

**¹⁷** Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.

**¹⁸** He redeems my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.

**¹⁹** God will hear and humiliate them— the One enthroned for the ages— Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God.

**²⁰** My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.

**²¹** His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed.

**²²** Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.

**²³** But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.

[^2265]: 55:0 Maskil is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 32, 42, 44–45, 52–55, 74, 78, 88–89, and 142.
