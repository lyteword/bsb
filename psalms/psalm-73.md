# Psalm 73

## Surely God Is Good to Israel

A Psalm of Asaph.

**¹** Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.

**²** But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.

**³** For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

**⁴** They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed.

**⁵** They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.

**⁶** Therefore pride is their necklace; a garment of violence covers them.

**⁷** From their prosperity proceeds iniquity;[^2300] the imaginations of their hearts run wild.

**⁸** They mock and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.

**⁹** They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues strut across the earth.

**¹⁰** So their people [^2301] return to this place and drink up waters in abundance.

**¹¹** The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?”

**¹²** Behold, these are the wicked— always carefree as they increase their wealth.

**¹³** Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; in innocence I have washed my hands.

**¹⁴** For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.

**¹⁵** If I had said, “I will speak this way,” then I would have betrayed Your children.

**¹⁶** When I tried to understand all this, it was troublesome in my sight

**¹⁷** until I entered God’s sanctuary; then I discerned their end.

**¹⁸** Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin.

**¹⁹** How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors!

**²⁰** Like one waking from a dream, so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.

**²¹** When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within,

**²²** I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You.

**²³** Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.

**²⁴** You guide me with Your counsel, and later receive me in glory.

**²⁵** Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You.

**²⁶** My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength [^2302] of my heart and my portion forever.

**²⁷** Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.

**²⁸** But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may proclaim all Your works.
