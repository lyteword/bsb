# Psalm 103

## Bless the LORD, O My Soul

Of David.

**¹** Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name.

**²** Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all His kind deeds—

**³** He who forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases,

**⁴** who redeems your life from the Pit and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,

**⁵** who satisfies you with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

**⁶** The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.

**⁷** He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.

**⁸** The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.

**⁹** He will not always accuse us, nor harbor His anger forever.

**¹⁰** He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities.

**¹¹** For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.

**¹²** As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

**¹³** As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.

**¹⁴** For He knows our frame; He is mindful that we are dust.

**¹⁵** As for man, his days are like grass— he blooms like a flower of the field;

**¹⁶** when the wind passes over, it vanishes, and its place remembers it no more.

**¹⁷** But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children—

**¹⁸** to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts.

**¹⁹** The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.

**²⁰** Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command.

**²¹** Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will.

**²²** Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
