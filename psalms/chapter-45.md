# Chapter 45

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies.” A Maskil of the sons of Korah. A love song. My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer. 

<sup>2</sup> You are the most handsome of men; grace has anointed your lips, since God has blessed you forever. 

<sup>3</sup> Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior; appear in your majesty and splendor. 

<sup>4</sup> In your splendor ride forth in victory on behalf of truth and humility and justice; may your right hand show your awesome deeds. 

<sup>5</sup> Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s foes; the nations fall beneath your feet. 

<sup>6</sup> Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever, and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom. 

<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you above your companions with the oil of joy. 

<sup>8</sup> All your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces of ivory the harps make you glad. 

<sup>9</sup> The daughters of kings are among your honored women; the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with the gold of Ophir. 

<sup>10</sup> Listen, O daughter! Consider and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father’s house, 

<sup>11</sup> and the king will desire your beauty; bow to him, for he is your lord. 

<sup>12</sup> The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; men of wealth will seek your favor. 

<sup>13</sup> All glorious is the princess in her chamber; her gown is embroidered with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> In colorful garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions are brought before you. 

<sup>15</sup> They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king. 

<sup>16</sup> Your sons will succeed your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land. 

<sup>17</sup> I will commemorate your name through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.
