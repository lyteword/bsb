# Psalm 20

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. 

<sup>2</sup> May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> May He remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. 

<sup>4</sup> May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed. 

<sup>5</sup> May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your petitions. 

<sup>6</sup> Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God. 

<sup>8</sup> They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm. 

<sup>9</sup> O LORD, save the king. Answer us on the day we call.
