For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.

**²** May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.

**³** May He remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. Selah

**⁴** May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed.

**⁵** May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your petitions.

**⁶** Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.

**⁷** Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.

**⁸** They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.

**⁹** O LORD, save [^2183] the king. Answer us on the day we call.
