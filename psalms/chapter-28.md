# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Of David. To You, O LORD, I call; be not deaf to me, O my Rock. For if You remain silent, I will be like those descending to the Pit. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my cry for mercy when I call to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary. 

<sup>3</sup> Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> Repay them according to their deeds and for their works of evil. Repay them for what their hands have done; bring back on them what they deserve. 

<sup>5</sup> Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done, He will tear them down and never rebuild them. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard my cry for mercy. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I give thanks to Him with my song. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD is the strength of His people, a stronghold of salvation for His anointed. 

<sup>9</sup> Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
