# Psalm 6

## Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger

**(Psalms 38:1–22)**

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith.[^2150] A Psalm of David.

**¹** O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.

**²** Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.

**³** My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long?

**⁴** Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion.

**⁵** For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol?

**⁶** I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.

**⁷** My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes.

**⁸** Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping.

**⁹** The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.

**¹⁰** All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.

[^2150]: 6:0 Sheminith is probably a musical term; here and in 1 Chronicles 15:21 and Psalms 12:1.
