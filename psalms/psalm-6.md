# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony. 

<sup>3</sup> My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long? 

<sup>4</sup> Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion. 

<sup>5</sup> For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol? 

<sup>6</sup> I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears. 

<sup>7</sup> My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes. 

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
