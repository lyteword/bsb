# Psalm 114

## A Psalm of Exodus

**¹** When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,

**²** Judah became God’s sanctuary, Israel His dominion.

**³** The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;

**⁴** the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.

**⁵** Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,

**⁶** O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?

**⁷** Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

**⁸** who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
