# Psalm 60

## Victory with God

**(2 Samuel 8:1–14; 1 Chronicles 18:1–13; Psalms 108:1–13)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A Miktam [^2275] of David for instruction. When he fought Aram-naharaim [^2276] and Aram-zobah,[^2277] and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

<sup>1</sup> You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!

<sup>2</sup> You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking.

<sup>3</sup> You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.

<sup>4</sup> You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow.[^2278] Selah

<sup>5</sup> Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered.

<sup>6</sup> God has spoken from His sanctuary:[^2279] “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.

<sup>7</sup> Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter.

<sup>8</sup> Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

<sup>10</sup> Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?

<sup>11</sup> Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.

<sup>12</sup> With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.

[^2275]: 60:0 Miktam is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 16 and 56–60.
[^2276]: 60:0 That is, Mesopotamia; Aram-naharaim means Aram of the two rivers, likely the region between the Euphrates and Balih Rivers in northwestern Mesopotamia.
[^2277]: 60:0 That is, the land northeast of Damascus
[^2278]: 60:4 Or that it may be displayed because of truth
[^2279]: 60:6 Or in His holiness
