# Psalm 60

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A Miktam of David for instruction. When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us! 

<sup>2</sup> You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking. 

<sup>3</sup> You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink. 

<sup>4</sup> You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow. 

<sup>5</sup> Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered. 

<sup>6</sup> God has spoken from His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth. 

<sup>7</sup> Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter. 

<sup>8</sup> Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.” 

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

<sup>10</sup> Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies? 

<sup>11</sup> Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless. 

<sup>12</sup> With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
