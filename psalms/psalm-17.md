# Psalm 17

## Hear My Righteous Plea

A prayer of David.

**¹** Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer— it comes from lips free of deceit.

**²** May my vindication come from Your presence; may Your eyes see what is right.

**³** You have tried my heart; You have visited me in the night. You have tested me and found no evil; I have resolved not to sin with my mouth.

**⁴** As for the deeds of men— by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.

**⁵** My steps have held to Your paths; my feet have not slipped.

**⁶** I call on You, O God, for You will answer me. Incline Your ear to me; hear my words.

**⁷** Show the wonders of Your loving devotion, You who save by Your right hand those who seek refuge from their foes.

**⁸** Keep me as the apple of [^2173] Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings

**⁹** from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.

**¹⁰** They have closed their callous hearts; their mouths speak with arrogance.

**¹¹** They have tracked us down, and now surround us; their eyes are set to cast us to the ground,

**¹²** like a lion greedy for prey, like a young lion lurking in ambush.

**¹³** Arise, O LORD, confront them! Bring them to their knees; deliver me from the wicked by Your sword,

**¹⁴** from such men, O LORD, by Your hand— from men of the world whose portion is in this life. May You fill the bellies of Your treasured ones [^2174] and satisfy their sons, so they leave their abundance to their children.

**¹⁵** As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied in Your presence.

[^2173]: 17:8 Literally as the pupil, the daughter of
[^2174]: 17:14 Or May what You have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies
