# Psalm 24

## The Earth Is the LORD’s

A Psalm of David.

**¹** The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof,[^2193] the world and all who dwell therein.

**²** For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.

**³** Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?

**⁴** He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol [^2194] or swear deceitfully.

**⁵** He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from the God of his salvation.

**⁶** Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob.[^2195] Selah

**⁷** Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

**⁸** Who is this King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

**⁹** Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

**¹⁰** Who is He, this King of Glory? The LORD of Hosts— He is the King of Glory. Selah
