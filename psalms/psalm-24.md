# Psalm 24

## The Earth Is the LORD’s

A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof,[^2193] the world and all who dwell therein.

<sup>2</sup> For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.

<sup>3</sup> Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?

<sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol [^2194] or swear deceitfully.

<sup>5</sup> He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from the God of his salvation.

<sup>6</sup> Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob.[^2195] Selah

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

<sup>8</sup> Who is this King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

<sup>10</sup> Who is He, this King of Glory? The LORD of Hosts— He is the King of Glory. Selah
