# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

<sup>2</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters. 

<sup>3</sup> He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name. 

<sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 

<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
