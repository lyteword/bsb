# Chapter 125

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever. 

<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore. 

<sup>3</sup> For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice. 

<sup>4</sup> Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart. 

<sup>5</sup> But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
