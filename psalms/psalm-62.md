# Psalm 62

## Waiting on God

For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

**¹** In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.

**²** He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress; I will never be shaken.

**³** How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?

**⁴** They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch; they delight in lies; with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah

**⁵** Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.

**⁶** He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress; I will not be shaken.

**⁷** My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock; my refuge is in God.

**⁸** Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah

**⁹** Lowborn men are but a vapor; the exalted are but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they go up; together they are but a vapor.

**¹⁰** Place no trust in extortion or false hope in stolen goods. If your riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.

**¹¹** God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God,

**¹²** and loving devotion to You, O Lord. For You will repay each man according to his deeds.[^2280]
