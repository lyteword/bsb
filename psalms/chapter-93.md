# Chapter 93

<sup>1</sup> The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity. 

<sup>3</sup> The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves. 

<sup>4</sup> Above the roar of many waters— the mighty breakers of the sea— the LORD on high is majestic. 

<sup>5</sup> Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
