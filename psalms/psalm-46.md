# Psalm 46

## God Is Our Refuge and Strength

**(2 Kings 18:13–16; 2 Chronicles 32:1–8)**

For the choirmaster. Of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth.[^2243] A song.

**¹** God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.

**²** Therefore we will not fear, though the earth is transformed and the mountains are toppled into the depths of the seas,

**³** though their waters roar and foam and the mountains quake in the surge. Selah

**⁴** There is a river whose streams delight the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.

**⁵** God is within her; she will not be moved. God will help her when morning dawns.

**⁶** Nations rage, kingdoms crumble; the earth melts when He lifts His voice.

**⁷** The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah

**⁸** Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation upon the earth.

**⁹** He makes wars to cease throughout the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the shields [^2244] in the fire.

**¹⁰** “Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted over the earth.”

**¹¹** The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah

[^2243]: 46:0 Alamoth is probably a musical or liturgical term; here and in 1 Chronicles 15:20.
[^2244]: 46:9 Or chariots
