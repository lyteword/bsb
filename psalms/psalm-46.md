# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. Of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A song. God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore we will not fear, though the earth is transformed and the mountains are toppled into the depths of the seas, 

<sup>3</sup> though their waters roar and foam and the mountains quake in the surge. 

<sup>4</sup> There is a river whose streams delight the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 

<sup>5</sup> God is within her; she will not be moved. God will help her when morning dawns. 

<sup>6</sup> Nations rage, kingdoms crumble; the earth melts when He lifts His voice. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. 

<sup>8</sup> Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation upon the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He makes wars to cease throughout the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the shields in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> “Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted over the earth.” 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
