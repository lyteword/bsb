# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side— let Israel now declare— 

<sup>2</sup> if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us, 

<sup>3</sup> when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive, 

<sup>4</sup> then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us, 

<sup>5</sup> then the raging waters would have swept us away. 

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth. 

<sup>7</sup> We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away. 

<sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
