# Psalm 124

## Our Help Is in the Name of the LORD

A song of ascents. Of David.

**¹** If the LORD had not been on our side— let Israel now declare—

**²** if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,

**³** when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,

**⁴** then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,

**⁵** then the raging waters would have swept us away.

**⁶** Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.

**⁷** We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.

**⁸** Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
