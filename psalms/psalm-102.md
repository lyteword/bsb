# Psalm 102

## The Prayer of the Afflicted

A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD.

**¹** Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come before You.

**²** Do not hide Your face from me in my day of distress. Incline Your ear to me; answer me quickly when I call.

**³** For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers.

**⁴** My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my bread.

**⁵** Through my loud groaning my skin hangs on my bones.

**⁶** I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.

**⁷** I lie awake; I am like a lone bird on a housetop.

**⁸** All day long my enemies taunt me; they ridicule me and curse me.

**⁹** For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears

**¹⁰** because of Your indignation and wrath, for You have picked me up and cast me aside.

**¹¹** My days are like lengthening shadows, and I wither away like grass.

**¹²** But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures to all generations.

**¹³** You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor— the appointed time has come.

**¹⁴** For Your servants delight in her stones and take pity on her dust.

**¹⁵** So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory.

**¹⁶** For the LORD will rebuild Zion; He has appeared in His glory.

**¹⁷** He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their prayer.

**¹⁸** Let this be written for the generation to come, so that a people not yet created may praise the LORD.

**¹⁹** For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth

**²⁰** to hear a prisoner’s groaning, to release those condemned to death,

**²¹** that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion and praise Him in Jerusalem,

**²²** when peoples and kingdoms assemble to serve the LORD.

**²³** He has broken my strength on the way; He has cut short my days.

**²⁴** I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days! Your years go on through all generations.

**²⁵** In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

**²⁶** They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on.

**²⁷** But You remain the same, and Your years will never end.[^2353]

**²⁸** The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You.”
