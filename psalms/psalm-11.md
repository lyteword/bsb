# Psalm 11

## In the LORD I Take Refuge

**(Habakkuk 1:12–17)**

For the choirmaster. Of David.

**¹** In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain!

**²** For behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrow on the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.

**³** If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”

**⁴** The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne. His eyes are watching closely; they examine the sons of men.

**⁵** The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.

**⁶** On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur; a scorching wind will be their portion.

**⁷** For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice. The upright will see His face.
