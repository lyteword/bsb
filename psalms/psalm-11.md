# Psalm 11

## In the LORD I Take Refuge

**(Habakkuk 1:12–17)**

For the choirmaster. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain!

<sup>2</sup> For behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrow on the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.

<sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”

<sup>4</sup> The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne. His eyes are watching closely; they examine the sons of men.

<sup>5</sup> The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.

<sup>6</sup> On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur; a scorching wind will be their portion.

<sup>7</sup> For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice. The upright will see His face.
