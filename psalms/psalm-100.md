# Psalm 100

## Make a Joyful Noise

**(Psalms 66:1–20)**

A Psalm of thanksgiving.

**¹** Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.

**²** Serve the LORD with gladness; come into His presence with joyful songs.

**³** Know that the LORD is God. It is He who made us, and we are His;[^2352] we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.

**⁴** Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name.

**⁵** For the LORD is good, and His loving devotion endures forever; His faithfulness continues to all generations.

[^2352]: 100:3 Or and not we ourselves
