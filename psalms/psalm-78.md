# Psalm 78

## I Will Open My Mouth in Parables

**(Matthew 13:34–35)**

A Maskil [^2311] of Asaph.

<sup>1</sup> Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; listen to the words of my mouth.

<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the beginning,[^2312]

<sup>3</sup> that we have heard and known and our fathers have relayed to us.

<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might and the wonders He has performed.

<sup>5</sup> For He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children,

<sup>6</sup> that the coming generation would know them— even children yet to be born— to arise and tell their own children

<sup>7</sup> that they should put their confidence in God, not forgetting His works, but keeping His commandments.

<sup>8</sup> Then they will not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose heart was not loyal, whose spirit was not faithful to God.

<sup>9</sup> The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.

<sup>10</sup> They failed to keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.

<sup>11</sup> They forgot what He had done, the wonders He had shown them.

<sup>12</sup> He worked wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.

<sup>13</sup> He split the sea and brought them through; He set the waters upright like a wall.

<sup>14</sup> He led them with a cloud by day and with a light of fire all night.

<sup>15</sup> He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.

<sup>16</sup> He brought streams from the stone and made water flow down like rivers.

<sup>17</sup> But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.

<sup>18</sup> They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.

<sup>19</sup> They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?

<sup>20</sup> When He struck the rock, water gushed out and torrents raged. But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?”

<sup>21</sup> Therefore the LORD heard and was filled with wrath; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and His anger flared against Israel,

<sup>22</sup> because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.

<sup>23</sup> Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.

<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.[^2313]

<sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.

<sup>26</sup> He stirred the east wind from the heavens and drove the south wind by His might.

<sup>27</sup> He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.

<sup>28</sup> He felled them in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.

<sup>29</sup> So they ate and were well filled, for He gave them what they craved.

<sup>30</sup> Yet before they had filled their desire, with the food still in their mouths,

<sup>31</sup> God’s anger flared against them, and He put to death their strongest and subdued the young men of Israel.

<sup>32</sup> In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.

<sup>33</sup> So He ended their days in futility,[^2314] and their years in sudden terror.

<sup>34</sup> When He slew them, they would seek Him; they repented and searched for God.

<sup>35</sup> And they remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High [^2315] was their Redeemer.

<sup>36</sup> But they deceived Him with their mouths, and lied to Him with their tongues.

<sup>37</sup> Their hearts were disloyal to Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.

<sup>38</sup> And yet He was compassionate; He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. He often restrained His anger and did not unleash His full wrath.

<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.

<sup>40</sup> How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert!

<sup>41</sup> Again and again they tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

<sup>42</sup> They did not remember His power [^2316]— the day He redeemed them from the adversary,

<sup>43</sup> when He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.

<sup>44</sup> He turned their rivers to blood, and from their streams they could not drink.

<sup>45</sup> He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.

<sup>46</sup> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.

<sup>47</sup> He killed their vines with hailstones and their sycamore-figs with sleet.[^2317]

<sup>48</sup> He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.

<sup>49</sup> He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity— a band of destroying angels.

<sup>50</sup> He cleared a path for His anger; He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.

<sup>51</sup> He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, the virility in the tents of Ham.

<sup>52</sup> He led out His people like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.

<sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so they did not fear, but the sea engulfed their enemies.

<sup>54</sup> He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had acquired.

<sup>55</sup> He drove out nations before them and apportioned their inheritance; He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

<sup>56</sup> But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, for they did not keep His decrees.

<sup>57</sup> They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, twisted like a faulty bow.

<sup>58</sup> They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their idols.

<sup>59</sup> On hearing it, God was furious and rejected Israel completely.

<sup>60</sup> He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.

<sup>61</sup> He delivered His strength to captivity, and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.

<sup>62</sup> He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged by His heritage.

<sup>63</sup> Fire consumed His young men, and their maidens were left without wedding songs.

<sup>64</sup> His priests fell by the sword, but their widows could not lament.

<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.

<sup>66</sup> He beat back His foes; He put them to everlasting shame.

<sup>67</sup> He rejected the tent of Joseph and refused the tribe of Ephraim.

<sup>68</sup> But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.

<sup>69</sup> He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth He has established forever.

<sup>70</sup> He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;

<sup>71</sup> from tending the ewes He brought him to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.

<sup>72</sup> So David shepherded them with integrity of heart and guided them with skillful hands.
