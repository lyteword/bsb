# Psalm 84

## Better Is One Day in Your Courts

**(John 1:14–18)**

For the choirmaster. According to Gittith.[^2326] A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

**¹** How lovely is Your dwelling place, O LORD of Hosts!

**²** My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.

**³** Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she places her young near Your altars, O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.

**⁴** How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah

**⁵** Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.

**⁶** As they pass through the Valley of Baca,[^2327] they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools.[^2328]

**⁷** They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion.

**⁸** O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah

**⁹** Take notice of our shield, O God, and look with favor on the face of Your anointed.

**¹⁰** For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.

**¹¹** For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.

**¹²** O LORD of Hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in You!

[^2326]: 84:0 Gittith is probably a musical or liturgical term; here and in Psalms 8 and 81.
[^2327]: 84:6 Or Valley of Poplars
[^2328]: 84:6 Or with blessings
