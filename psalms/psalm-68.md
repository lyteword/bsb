# Psalm 68

## God’s Enemies Are Scattered

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song.

**¹** God arises. His enemies are scattered, and those who hate Him flee His presence.

**²** As smoke is blown away, You will drive them out; as wax melts before the fire, the wicked will perish in the presence of God.

**³** But the righteous will be glad and rejoice before God; they will celebrate with joy.

**⁴** Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds [^2285]— His name is the LORD— and rejoice before Him.

**⁵** A father of the fatherless and a defender of widows is God in His holy habitation.

**⁶** God settles the lonely in families; He leads the prisoners out to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.

**⁷** O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wasteland, Selah

**⁸** the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain before God, the One on Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.

**⁹** You sent abundant rain, O God; You refreshed Your weary inheritance.

**¹⁰** Your flock settled therein; O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor.

**¹¹** The Lord gives the command; a great company of women proclaim it:

**¹²** “Kings and their armies flee in haste; she who waits at home divides the plunder.

**¹³** Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her feathers with shimmering gold.”

**¹⁴** When the Almighty [^2286] scattered the kings in the land, it was like the snow falling on Zalmon.

**¹⁵** A mountain of God is Mount Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is Mount Bashan.

**¹⁶** Why do you gaze in envy, O mountains of many peaks? This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling, where the LORD will surely dwell forever.

**¹⁷** The chariots of God are tens of thousands— thousands of thousands are they; the Lord is in His sanctuary as He was at Sinai.[^2287]

**¹⁸** You have ascended on high; You have led captives away. You have received gifts from men,[^2288] even from the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.

**¹⁹** Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, the God of our salvation. Selah

**²⁰** Our God is a God of deliverance; the Lord GOD is our rescuer from death.

**²¹** Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy crowns of those who persist in guilty ways.

**²²** The Lord said, “I will retrieve them from Bashan, I will bring them up from the depths of the sea,

**²³** that your foot may be dipped in the blood of your foes— the tongues of your dogs in the same.”

**²⁴** They have seen Your procession, O God— the march of my God and King into the sanctuary.

**²⁵** The singers lead the way, the musicians follow after, among the maidens playing tambourines.

**²⁶** Bless God in the great congregation; bless the LORD from the fountain of Israel.

**²⁷** There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah in their company, the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.

**²⁸** Summon Your power, O God;[^2289] show Your strength, O God, which You have exerted on our behalf.

**²⁹** Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring You gifts.

**³⁰** Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations, until it submits, bringing bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.

**³¹** Envoys will arrive from Egypt; Cush [^2290] will stretch out her hands to God.

**³²** Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord— Selah

**³³** to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old; behold, His mighty voice resounds.

**³⁴** Ascribe the power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose strength is in the skies.

**³⁵** O God, You are awesome in Your sanctuary; the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be God!
