# Psalm 23

## The LORD Is My Shepherd

**(Ezekiel 34:11–24; John 10:1–21)**

A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> The LORD is my shepherd;[^2190] I shall not want.

<sup>2</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.

<sup>3</sup> He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.

<sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,[^2191] I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.[^2192]

[^2190]: 23:1 See Revelation 7:17.
[^2191]: 23:4 Or the valley of deep darkness
[^2192]: 23:6 Literally for a length of days
