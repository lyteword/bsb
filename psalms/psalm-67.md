# Psalm 67

## May God Cause His Face to Shine upon Us

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.

<sup>1</sup> May God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us, Selah

<sup>2</sup> that Your ways may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.

<sup>3</sup> Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.

<sup>4</sup> Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for You judge the peoples justly and lead the nations of the earth. Selah

<sup>5</sup> Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.

<sup>6</sup> The earth has yielded its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.

<sup>7</sup> God blesses us, that all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
