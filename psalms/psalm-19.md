# Psalm 19

## The Heavens Declare the Glory of God

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.

**²** Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.

**³** Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard,[^2180]

**⁴** their voice [^2181] has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.[^2182] In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.

**⁵** Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course,

**⁶** it rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.

**⁷** The Law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple.

**⁸** The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

**⁹** The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.

**¹⁰** They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

**¹¹** By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward.

**¹²** Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.

**¹³** Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression.

**¹⁴** May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
