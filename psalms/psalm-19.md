# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands. 

<sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard, 

<sup>4</sup> their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun. 

<sup>5</sup> Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course, 

<sup>6</sup> it rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth. 

<sup>7</sup> The Law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple. 

<sup>8</sup> The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous. 

<sup>10</sup> They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb. 

<sup>11</sup> By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults. 

<sup>13</sup> Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
