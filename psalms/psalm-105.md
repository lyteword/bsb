# Psalm 105

## Tell of His Wonders

**(1 Chronicles 16:7–22)**

**¹** Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.

**²** Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.

**³** Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.

**⁴** Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.

**⁵** Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,

**⁶** O offspring of His servant Abraham, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

**⁷** He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.

**⁸** He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—

**⁹** the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.

**¹⁰** He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:

**¹¹** “I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”

**¹²** When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,

**¹³** they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.

**¹⁴** He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:

**¹⁵** “Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!”

**¹⁶** He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies [^2359] of food.

**¹⁷** He sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave.

**¹⁸** They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,

**¹⁹** until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right.

**²⁰** The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.

**²¹** He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,

**²²** to instruct [^2360] his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.

**²³** Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.

**²⁴** And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,

**²⁵** whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.

**²⁶** He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.

**²⁷** They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

**²⁸** He sent darkness, and it became dark— yet they defied His words.[^2361]

**²⁹** He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die.

**³⁰** Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.

**³¹** He spoke, and insects swarmed— gnats throughout their country.

**³²** He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.

**³³** He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.

**³⁴** He spoke, and the locusts came— young locusts without number.

**³⁵** They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.

**³⁶** Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.

**³⁷** He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.

**³⁸** Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.

**³⁹** He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.

**⁴⁰** They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

**⁴¹** He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.

**⁴²** For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.

**⁴³** He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.

**⁴⁴** He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,

**⁴⁵** that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah![^2362]
