# Psalm 66

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth! 

<sup>2</sup> Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious. 

<sup>3</sup> Say to God, “How awesome are Your deeds! So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You. 

<sup>4</sup> All the earth bows down to You; they sing praise to You; they sing praise to Your name.” 

<sup>5</sup> Come and see the works of God; how awesome are His deeds toward mankind. 

<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the waters on foot; there we rejoiced in Him. 

<sup>7</sup> He rules forever by His power; His eyes watch the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. 

<sup>8</sup> Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard. 

<sup>9</sup> He preserves our lives and keeps our feet from slipping. 

<sup>10</sup> For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us like silver. 

<sup>11</sup> You led us into the net; You laid burdens on our backs. 

<sup>12</sup> You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us into abundance. 

<sup>13</sup> I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You— 

<sup>14</sup> the vows that my lips promised and my mouth spoke in my distress. 

<sup>15</sup> I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. 

<sup>16</sup> Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for me. 

<sup>17</sup> I cried out to Him with my mouth and praised Him with my tongue. 

<sup>18</sup> If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 

<sup>19</sup> But God has surely heard; He has attended to the sound of my prayer. 

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld from me His loving devotion!
