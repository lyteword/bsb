# Psalm 66

## Make a Joyful Noise

**(Psalms 100:1–5)**

For the choirmaster. A song. A Psalm.

**¹** Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth!

**²** Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.

**³** Say to God, “How awesome are Your deeds! So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You.

**⁴** All the earth bows down to You; they sing praise to You; they sing praise to Your name.” Selah

**⁵** Come and see the works of God; how awesome are His deeds toward mankind.

**⁶** He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the waters on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.

**⁷** He rules forever by His power; His eyes watch the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah

**⁸** Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.

**⁹** He preserves our lives and keeps our feet from slipping.

**¹⁰** For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us like silver.

**¹¹** You led us into the net; You laid burdens on our backs.

**¹²** You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us into abundance.

**¹³** I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You—

**¹⁴** the vows that my lips promised and my mouth spoke in my distress.

**¹⁵** I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah

**¹⁶** Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for me.

**¹⁷** I cried out to Him with my mouth and praised Him with my tongue.[^2284]

**¹⁸** If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

**¹⁹** But God has surely heard; He has attended to the sound of my prayer.

**²⁰** Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld from me His loving devotion!

[^2284]: 66:17 Or and His praise was on my tongue
