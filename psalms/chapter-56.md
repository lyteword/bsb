# Chapter 56

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day they press their attack. 

<sup>2</sup> My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me. 

<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I put my trust in You. 

<sup>4</sup> In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are on my demise. 

<sup>6</sup> They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life. 

<sup>7</sup> In spite of such sin, will they escape? In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations. 

<sup>8</sup> You have taken account of my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle— are they not in Your book? 

<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side. 

<sup>10</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise, 

<sup>11</sup> in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>12</sup> Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You. 

<sup>13</sup> For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
