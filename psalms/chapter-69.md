# Chapter 69

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck. 

<sup>2</sup> I have sunk into the miry depths, where there is no footing; I have drifted into deep waters, where the flood engulfs me. 

<sup>3</sup> I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without cause outnumber the hairs of my head; many are those who would destroy me— my enemies for no reason. Though I did not steal, I must repay. 

<sup>5</sup> You know my folly, O God, and my guilt is not hidden from You. 

<sup>6</sup> May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of Hosts; may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> For I have endured scorn for Your sake, and shame has covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, 

<sup>9</sup> because zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me. 

<sup>10</sup> I wept and fasted, but it brought me reproach. 

<sup>11</sup> I made sackcloth my clothing, and I was sport to them. 

<sup>12</sup> Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> But my prayer to You, O LORD, is for a time of favor. In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, answer me with Your sure salvation. 

<sup>14</sup> Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink; deliver me from my foes and out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> Do not let the floods engulf me or the depths swallow me up; let not the Pit close its mouth over me. 

<sup>16</sup> Answer me, O LORD, for Your loving devotion is good; turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion. 

<sup>17</sup> Hide not Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly! 

<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul and redeem me; ransom me because of my foes. 

<sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. All my adversaries are before You. 

<sup>20</sup> Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found no one. 

<sup>21</sup> They poisoned my food with gall and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst. 

<sup>22</sup> May their table become a snare; may it be a retribution and a trap. 

<sup>23</sup> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever. 

<sup>24</sup> Pour out Your wrath upon them, and let Your burning anger overtake them. 

<sup>25</sup> May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> For they persecute the one You struck and recount the pain of those You wounded. 

<sup>27</sup> Add iniquity to their iniquity; let them not share in Your righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> May they be blotted out of the Book of Life and not listed with the righteous. 

<sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress; let Your salvation protect me, O God. 

<sup>30</sup> I will praise God’s name in song and exalt Him with thanksgiving. 

<sup>31</sup> And this will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves. 

<sup>32</sup> The humble will see and rejoice. You who seek God, let your hearts be revived! 

<sup>33</sup> For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise His captive people. 

<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them. 

<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it. 

<sup>36</sup> The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will settle in it.
