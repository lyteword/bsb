# Psalm 65

## Praise Awaits God in Zion

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song.

**¹** Praise awaits You, O God, in Zion; to You our vows will be fulfilled.

**²** O You who listen to prayer, all people will come to You.

**³** When iniquities prevail against me, You atone for our transgressions.

**⁴** Blessed is the one You choose and bring near to dwell in Your courts! We are filled with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.

**⁵** With awesome deeds of righteousness You answer us, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.

**⁶** You formed the mountains by Your power, having girded Yourself with might.

**⁷** You stilled the roaring of the seas, the pounding of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.

**⁸** Those who live far away fear Your wonders; You make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.[^2281]

**⁹** You attend to the earth and water it;[^2282] with abundance You enrich it. The streams of God are full of water, for You prepare our grain by providing for the earth.[^2283]

**¹⁰** You soak its furrows and level its ridges; You soften it with showers and bless its growth.

**¹¹** You crown the year with Your bounty, and Your paths overflow with plenty.

**¹²** The pastures of the wilderness overflow; the hills are robed with joy.

**¹³** The pastures are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are decked with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.

[^2281]: 65:8 Or where morning dawns and evening fades You call forth songs of joy.
[^2282]: 65:9 Or and make it overflow
[^2283]: 65:9 Or to provide the people with grain, for so You have ordained it
