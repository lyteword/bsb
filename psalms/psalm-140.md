# Psalm 140

## Rescue Me from Evil Men

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence,

**²** who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long.

**³** They sharpen their tongues like snakes; the venom of vipers is on their lips.[^2421] Selah

**⁴** Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble.

**⁵** The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. Selah

**⁶** I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Hear, O LORD, my cry for help.

**⁷** O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle.

**⁸** Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah

**⁹** May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.

**¹⁰** May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again.

**¹¹** May no slanderer be established in the land; may calamity hunt down the man of violence.

**¹²** I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy.

**¹³** Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.

[^2421]: 140:3 Cited in Romans 3:13
