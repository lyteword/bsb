# Psalm 41

## Victory over Betrayal

**(John 13:18–30)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Blessed is the one who cares for the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.

**²** The LORD will protect and preserve him; He will bless him in the land and refuse to give him over to the will of his foes.

**³** The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness and restore him from his bed of sickness.

**⁴** I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.”

**⁵** My enemies say with malice: “When will he die and be forgotten?”

**⁶** My visitor speaks falsehood; he gathers slander in his heart; he goes out and spreads it abroad.

**⁷** All who hate me whisper against me; they imagine the worst for me:

**⁸** “A vile disease has been poured into him; he will never get up from where he lies!”

**⁹** Even my close friend whom I trusted, the one who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.[^2232]

**¹⁰** But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.

**¹¹** By this I know that You delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.

**¹²** In my integrity You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever.

**¹³** Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
