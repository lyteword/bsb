# Psalm 41

## Victory over Betrayal

**(John 13:18–30)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the one who cares for the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.

<sup>2</sup> The LORD will protect and preserve him; He will bless him in the land and refuse to give him over to the will of his foes.

<sup>3</sup> The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness and restore him from his bed of sickness.

<sup>4</sup> I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.”

<sup>5</sup> My enemies say with malice: “When will he die and be forgotten?”

<sup>6</sup> My visitor speaks falsehood; he gathers slander in his heart; he goes out and spreads it abroad.

<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper against me; they imagine the worst for me:

<sup>8</sup> “A vile disease has been poured into him; he will never get up from where he lies!”

<sup>9</sup> Even my close friend whom I trusted, the one who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.[^2232]

<sup>10</sup> But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.

<sup>11</sup> By this I know that You delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.

<sup>12</sup> In my integrity You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever.

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
