# Psalm 96

## Sing to the LORD, All the Earth

**(1 Chronicles 16:23–36)**

**¹** Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.

**²** Sing to the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation day after day.

**³** Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.

**⁴** For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.

**⁵** For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.

**⁶** Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.

**⁷** Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.

**⁸** Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.

**⁹** Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.

**¹⁰** Declare among the nations: “The LORD reigns!” The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity.

**¹¹** Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea resound, and all that fills it.

**¹²** Let the fields exult, and all that is in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy

**¹³** before the LORD, for He is coming— He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.
