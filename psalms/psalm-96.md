# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing to the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation day after day. 

<sup>3</sup> Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts. 

<sup>9</sup> Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Declare among the nations: “The LORD reigns!” The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea resound, and all that fills it. 

<sup>12</sup> Let the fields exult, and all that is in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy 

<sup>13</sup> before the LORD, for He is coming— He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.
