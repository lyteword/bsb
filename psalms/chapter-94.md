# Chapter 94

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth. 

<sup>2</sup> Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud. 

<sup>3</sup> How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked exult? 

<sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words; all workers of iniquity boast. 

<sup>5</sup> They crush Your people, O LORD; they oppress Your heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless. 

<sup>7</sup> They say, “The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.” 

<sup>8</sup> Take notice, O senseless among the people! O fools, when will you be wise? 

<sup>9</sup> He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? He who formed the eye, can He not see? 

<sup>10</sup> He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge? 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD, and teach from Your law, 

<sup>13</sup> to grant him relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. 

<sup>14</sup> For the LORD will not forsake His people; He will never abandon His heritage. 

<sup>15</sup> Surely judgment will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 

<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>17</sup> Unless the LORD had been my helper, I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence. 

<sup>18</sup> If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me. 

<sup>19</sup> When anxiety overwhelms me, Your consolation delights my soul. 

<sup>20</sup> Can a corrupt throne be Your ally— one devising mischief by decree? 

<sup>21</sup> They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 

<sup>22</sup> But the LORD has been my stronghold, and my God is my rock of refuge. 

<sup>23</sup> He will bring upon them their own iniquity and destroy them for their wickedness. The LORD our God will destroy them.
