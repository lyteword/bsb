# Psalm 88

<sup>1</sup> A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, the God of my salvation, day and night I cry out before You. 

<sup>2</sup> May my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry. 

<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol. 

<sup>4</sup> I am counted among those descending to the Pit. I am like a man without strength. 

<sup>5</sup> I am forsaken among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, who are cut off from Your care. 

<sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest Pit, in the darkest of the depths. 

<sup>7</sup> Your wrath weighs heavily upon me; all Your waves have submerged me. 

<sup>8</sup> You have removed my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them; I am confined and cannot escape. 

<sup>9</sup> My eyes grow dim with grief. I call to You daily, O LORD; I spread out my hands to You. 

<sup>10</sup> Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? 

<sup>11</sup> Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon ? 

<sup>12</sup> Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion? 

<sup>13</sup> But to You, O LORD, I cry for help; in the morning my prayer comes before You. 

<sup>14</sup> Why, O LORD, do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me? 

<sup>15</sup> From my youth I was afflicted and near death. I have borne Your terrors; I am in despair. 

<sup>16</sup> Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me. 

<sup>17</sup> All day long they engulf me like water; they enclose me on every side. 

<sup>18</sup> You have removed my beloved and my friend; darkness is my closest companion.
