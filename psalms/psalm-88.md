# Psalm 88

## I Cry Out before You

A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath Leannoth.[^2333] A Maskil [^2334] of Heman the Ezrahite.

**¹** O LORD, the God of my salvation, day and night I cry out before You.

**²** May my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry.

**³** For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.

**⁴** I am counted among those descending to the Pit. I am like a man without strength.

**⁵** I am forsaken among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, who are cut off from Your care.

**⁶** You have laid me in the lowest Pit, in the darkest of the depths.

**⁷** Your wrath weighs heavily upon me; all Your waves have submerged me. Selah

**⁸** You have removed my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them; I am confined and cannot escape.

**⁹** My eyes grow dim with grief. I call to You daily, O LORD; I spread out my hands to You.

**¹⁰** Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah

**¹¹** Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon [^2335]?

**¹²** Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?

**¹³** But to You, O LORD, I cry for help; in the morning my prayer comes before You.

**¹⁴** Why, O LORD, do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?

**¹⁵** From my youth I was afflicted and near death. I have borne Your terrors; I am in despair.

**¹⁶** Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.

**¹⁷** All day long they engulf me like water; they enclose me on every side.

**¹⁸** You have removed my beloved and my friend; darkness is my closest companion.
