# Chapter 132

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured, 

<sup>2</sup> how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 

<sup>3</sup> “I will not enter my house or get into my bed, 

<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, 

<sup>5</sup> until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 

<sup>6</sup> We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar. 

<sup>7</sup> Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool. 

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. 

<sup>9</sup> May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy. 

<sup>10</sup> For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne. 

<sup>12</sup> If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.” 

<sup>13</sup> For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home: 

<sup>14</sup> “This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home. 

<sup>15</sup> I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

<sup>16</sup> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy. 

<sup>17</sup> There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one. 

<sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam.”
