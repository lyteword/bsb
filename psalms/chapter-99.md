# Chapter 99

<sup>1</sup> The LORD reigns; let the nations tremble! He is enthroned above the cherubim; let the earth quake! 

<sup>2</sup> Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise Your great and awesome nameâ€” He is holy! 

<sup>4</sup> The mighty King loves justice. You have established equity; You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy! 

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among His priests; Samuel was among those who called on His name. They called to the LORD and He answered. 

<sup>7</sup> He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> O LORD our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, yet an avenger of their misdeeds. 

<sup>9</sup> Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.
