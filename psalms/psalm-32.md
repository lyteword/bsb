# Psalm 32

## The Joy of Forgiveness

**(Romans 4:1–12)**

Of David. A Maskil.[^2209]

**¹** Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.[^2210]

**²** Blessed is the man whose iniquity the LORD does not count against him,[^2211] in whose spirit there is no deceit.

**³** When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.

**⁴** For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained [^2212] as in the summer heat. Selah

**⁵** Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah

**⁶** Therefore let all the godly pray to You while You may be found. Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near.

**⁷** You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah

**⁸** I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will give you counsel and watch over you.

**⁹** Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding; they must be controlled with bit and bridle to make them come to you.

**¹⁰** Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in the LORD.

**¹¹** Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
