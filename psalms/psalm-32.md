# Psalm 32

<sup>1</sup> Of David. A Maskil. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man whose iniquity the LORD does not count against him, in whose spirit there is no deceit. 

<sup>3</sup> When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained as in the summer heat. 

<sup>5</sup> Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and You forgave the guilt of my sin. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore let all the godly pray to You while You may be found. Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near. 

<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. 

<sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will give you counsel and watch over you. 

<sup>9</sup> Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding; they must be controlled with bit and bridle to make them come to you. 

<sup>10</sup> Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in the LORD. 

<sup>11</sup> Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
