# Chapter 136

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. 

<sup>2</sup> Give thanks to the God of gods. 

<sup>3</sup> Give thanks to the Lord of lords. 

<sup>4</sup> He alone does great wonders. 

<sup>5</sup> By His insight He made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> He spread out the earth upon the waters. 

<sup>7</sup> He made the great lights— 

<sup>8</sup> the sun to rule the day, 

<sup>9</sup> the moon and stars to govern the night. 

<sup>10</sup> He struck down the firstborn of Egypt 

<sup>11</sup> and brought Israel out from among them 

<sup>12</sup> with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. 

<sup>13</sup> He divided the Red Sea in two 

<sup>14</sup> and led Israel through the midst, 

<sup>15</sup> but swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea. 

<sup>16</sup> He led His people through the wilderness. 

<sup>17</sup> He struck down great kings 

<sup>18</sup> and slaughtered mighty kings— 

<sup>19</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites 

<sup>20</sup> and Og king of Bashan— 

<sup>21</sup> and He gave their land as an inheritance, 

<sup>22</sup> a heritage to His servant Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> He remembered us in our low estate 

<sup>24</sup> and freed us from our enemies. 

<sup>25</sup> He gives food to every creature. 

<sup>26</sup> Give thanks to the God of heaven!
