# Psalm 111

## Majestic Is His Work

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! [^2379] I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.

<sup>2</sup> Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them.

<sup>3</sup> Splendid and majestic is His work; His righteousness endures forever.

<sup>4</sup> He has caused His wonders to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and compassionate.

<sup>5</sup> He provides food for those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever.

<sup>6</sup> He has shown His people the power of His works by giving them the inheritance of the nations.

<sup>7</sup> The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are trustworthy.

<sup>8</sup> They are upheld forever and ever, enacted in truth and uprightness.

<sup>9</sup> He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His precepts gain rich understanding. His praise endures forever!
