# Chapter 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty. 

<sup>2</sup> He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; He stretches out the heavens like a tent, 

<sup>3</sup> laying the beams of His chambers in the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind. 

<sup>4</sup> He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants. 

<sup>5</sup> He set the earth on its foundations, never to be moved. 

<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away— 

<sup>8</sup> the mountains rose and the valleys sank to the place You assigned for them— 

<sup>9</sup> You set a boundary they cannot cross, that they may never again cover the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains. 

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> The birds of the air nest beside the springs; they sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from His chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works. 

<sup>14</sup> He makes the grass grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth: 

<sup>15</sup> wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil that makes his face to shine, and bread that sustains his heart. 

<sup>16</sup> The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted, 

<sup>17</sup> where the birds build their nests; the stork makes her home in the cypresses. 

<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers. 

<sup>19</sup> He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set. 

<sup>20</sup> You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl. 

<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. 

<sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they withdraw; they lie down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening. 

<sup>24</sup> How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures. 

<sup>25</sup> Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number, living things both great and small. 

<sup>26</sup> There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there. 

<sup>27</sup> All creatures look to You to give them their food in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things. 

<sup>29</sup> When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to dust. 

<sup>30</sup> When You send Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth. 

<sup>31</sup> May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works. 

<sup>32</sup> He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smolder. 

<sup>33</sup> I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>34</sup> May my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD. 

<sup>35</sup> May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah!
