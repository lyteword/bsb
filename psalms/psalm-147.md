# Psalm 147

## It Is Good to Sing Praises

**¹** Hallelujah! [^2430] How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!

**²** The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the exiles of Israel.

**³** He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.

**⁴** He determines the number of the stars; He calls them each by name.

**⁵** Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit.

**⁶** The LORD sustains the humble, but casts the wicked to the ground.

**⁷** Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music on the harp to our God,

**⁸** who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the hills.

**⁹** He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.

**¹⁰** He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

**¹¹** The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him, who hope in His loving devotion.

**¹²** Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion!

**¹³** For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses the children within you.

**¹⁴** He makes peace at your borders; He fills you with the finest wheat.

**¹⁵** He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.

**¹⁶** He spreads the snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;

**¹⁷** He casts forth His hail like pebbles.[^2431] Who can withstand His icy blast?

**¹⁸** He sends forth His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.

**¹⁹** He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.

**²⁰** He has done this for no other nation; they do not know His judgments.[^2432] Hallelujah!
