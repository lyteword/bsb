# Psalm 147

## It Is Good to Sing Praises

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! [^2430] How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!

<sup>2</sup> The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the exiles of Israel.

<sup>3</sup> He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.

<sup>4</sup> He determines the number of the stars; He calls them each by name.

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit.

<sup>6</sup> The LORD sustains the humble, but casts the wicked to the ground.

<sup>7</sup> Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music on the harp to our God,

<sup>8</sup> who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the hills.

<sup>9</sup> He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.

<sup>10</sup> He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.

<sup>11</sup> The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him, who hope in His loving devotion.

<sup>12</sup> Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion!

<sup>13</sup> For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses the children within you.

<sup>14</sup> He makes peace at your borders; He fills you with the finest wheat.

<sup>15</sup> He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.

<sup>16</sup> He spreads the snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;

<sup>17</sup> He casts forth His hail like pebbles.[^2431] Who can withstand His icy blast?

<sup>18</sup> He sends forth His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.

<sup>19</sup> He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.

<sup>20</sup> He has done this for no other nation; they do not know His judgments.[^2432] Hallelujah!

[^2430]: 147:1 Or Hallelu YAH, meaning Praise the LORD; also in verse 20
