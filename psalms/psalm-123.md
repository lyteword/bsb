# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven. 

<sup>2</sup> As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us mercy. 

<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have endured much contempt. 

<sup>4</sup> We have endured much scorn from the arrogant, much contempt from the proud.
