# Psalm 123

## I Lift Up My Eyes to You

A song of ascents.

**¹** I lift up my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven.

**²** As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us mercy.

**³** Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have endured much contempt.

**⁴** We have endured much scorn from the arrogant, much contempt from the proud.
