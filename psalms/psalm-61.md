# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> From the ends of the earth I call out to You whenever my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

<sup>3</sup> For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy. 

<sup>4</sup> Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. 

<sup>5</sup> For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name. 

<sup>6</sup> Increase the days of the king’s life; may his years span many generations. 

<sup>7</sup> May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him. 

<sup>8</sup> Then I will ever sing praise to Your name and fulfill my vows day by day.
