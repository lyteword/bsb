# Psalm 61

## You Have Heard My Vows

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. Of David.

**¹** Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.

**²** From the ends of the earth I call out to You whenever my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

**³** For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy.

**⁴** Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah

**⁵** For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.

**⁶** Increase the days of the king’s life; may his years span many generations.

**⁷** May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him.

**⁸** Then I will ever sing praise to Your name and fulfill my vows day by day.
