# Psalm 27

## The LORD Is My Salvation

Of David.

**¹** The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— whom shall I dread?

**²** When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh, my enemies and foes stumbled and fell.

**³** Though an army encamps around me, my heart will not fear; though a war breaks out against me, I will keep my trust.

**⁴** One thing I have asked of the LORD; this is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the LORD and seek Him in His temple.

**⁵** For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter; He will conceal me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high upon a rock.

**⁶** Then my head will be held high above my enemies around me. At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.

**⁷** Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call; be merciful and answer me.

**⁸** My heart said, “Seek His face.” Your face, O LORD, I will seek.

**⁹** Hide not Your face from me, nor turn away Your servant in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my salvation.

**¹⁰** Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.

**¹¹** Teach me Your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path, because of my oppressors.

**¹²** Do not hand me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.

**¹³** Still I am certain to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

**¹⁴** Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous. Wait patiently for the LORD!
