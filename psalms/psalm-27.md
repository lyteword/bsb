# Psalm 27

<sup>1</sup> Of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— whom shall I dread? 

<sup>2</sup> When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh, my enemies and foes stumbled and fell. 

<sup>3</sup> Though an army encamps around me, my heart will not fear; though a war breaks out against me, I will keep my trust. 

<sup>4</sup> One thing I have asked of the LORD; this is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the LORD and seek Him in His temple. 

<sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter; He will conceal me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high upon a rock. 

<sup>6</sup> Then my head will be held high above my enemies around me. At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call; be merciful and answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> My heart said, “Seek His face.” Your face, O LORD, I will seek. 

<sup>9</sup> Hide not Your face from me, nor turn away Your servant in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my salvation. 

<sup>10</sup> Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me. 

<sup>11</sup> Teach me Your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path, because of my oppressors. 

<sup>12</sup> Do not hand me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. 

<sup>13</sup> Still I am certain to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous. Wait patiently for the LORD!
