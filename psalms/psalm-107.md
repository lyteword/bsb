# Psalm 107

## Thanksgiving for Deliverance

**(Matthew 8:23–27; Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25)**

**¹** Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

**²** Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy

**³** and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.[^2370]

**⁴** Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell.

**⁵** They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them.

**⁶** Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress.

**⁷** He led them on a straight path to reach a city where they could live.

**⁸** Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.

**⁹** For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.

**¹⁰** Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains,

**¹¹** because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.

**¹²** He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.

**¹³** Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.

**¹⁴** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.

**¹⁵** Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.

**¹⁶** For He has broken down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.

**¹⁷** Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.

**¹⁸** They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death.

**¹⁹** Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.

**²⁰** He sent forth His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit.

**²¹** Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.

**²²** Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing.

**²³** Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters.

**²⁴** They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.

**²⁵** For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea.

**²⁶** They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish.

**²⁷** They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless.[^2371]

**²⁸** Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.

**²⁹** He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea [^2372] were hushed.

**³⁰** They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired.

**³¹** Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.

**³²** Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.

**³³** He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground,

**³⁴** and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.

**³⁵** He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs.

**³⁶** He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell.

**³⁷** They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.

**³⁸** He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish.

**³⁹** When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,

**⁴⁰** He pours out contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.

**⁴¹** But He lifts the needy from affliction and increases their families like flocks.

**⁴²** The upright see and rejoice, and all iniquity shuts its mouth.

**⁴³** Let him who is wise pay heed to these things and consider the loving devotion of the LORD.
