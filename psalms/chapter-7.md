# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, I take refuge in You; save me and deliver me from all my pursuers, 

<sup>2</sup> or they will shred my soul like a lion and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands, 

<sup>4</sup> if I have rewarded my ally with evil, if I have plundered my foe without cause, 

<sup>5</sup> then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. 

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; rise up against the fury of my enemies. Awake, my God, and ordain judgment. 

<sup>7</sup> Let the assembled peoples gather around You; take Your seat over them on high. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity. 

<sup>9</sup> Put an end to the evil of the wicked, but establish the righteous, O righteous God who searches hearts and minds. 

<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation each day. 

<sup>12</sup> If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow. 

<sup>13</sup> He has prepared His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; he conceives trouble and births falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; he has fallen into a pit of his own making. 

<sup>16</sup> His trouble recoils on himself, and his violence falls on his own head. 

<sup>17</sup> I will thank the LORD for His righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
