# Psalm 10

## The Perils of the Pilgrim

**¹** Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?

**²** In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.

**³** For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.

**⁴** In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.

**⁵** He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.

**⁶** He says to himself, “I will not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress.”

**⁷** His mouth is full of cursing, deceit,[^2160] and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.

**⁸** He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.

**⁹** He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.

**¹⁰** They are crushed and beaten down;[^2161] the helpless fall prey to his strength.

**¹¹** He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees.”

**¹²** Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! Do not forget the helpless.

**¹³** Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”

**¹⁴** But You have regarded trouble and grief; You see to repay it by Your hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.

**¹⁵** Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call him to account for his wickedness until none is left to be found.

**¹⁶** The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.

**¹⁷** You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,

**¹⁸** to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
