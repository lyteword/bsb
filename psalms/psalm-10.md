# Psalm 10

## The Perils of the Pilgrim

<sup>1</sup> Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?

<sup>2</sup> In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.

<sup>3</sup> For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.

<sup>4</sup> In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.

<sup>5</sup> He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.

<sup>6</sup> He says to himself, “I will not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress.”

<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit,[^2160] and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.

<sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.

<sup>9</sup> He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.

<sup>10</sup> They are crushed and beaten down;[^2161] the helpless fall prey to his strength.

<sup>11</sup> He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees.”

<sup>12</sup> Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! Do not forget the helpless.

<sup>13</sup> Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”

<sup>14</sup> But You have regarded trouble and grief; You see to repay it by Your hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.

<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call him to account for his wickedness until none is left to be found.

<sup>16</sup> The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.

<sup>17</sup> You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,

<sup>18</sup> to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
