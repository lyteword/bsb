# Chapter 68

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song. God arises. His enemies are scattered, and those who hate Him flee His presence. 

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is blown away, You will drive them out; as wax melts before the fire, the wicked will perish in the presence of God. 

<sup>3</sup> But the righteous will be glad and rejoice before God; they will celebrate with joy. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds — His name is the LORD— and rejoice before Him. 

<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, is God in His holy habitation. 

<sup>6</sup> God settles the lonely in families; He leads the prisoners out to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land. 

<sup>7</sup> O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wasteland, 

<sup>8</sup> the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain before God, the One on Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> You sent abundant rain, O God; You refreshed Your weary inheritance. 

<sup>10</sup> Your flock settled therein; O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord gives the command; a great company of women proclaim it: 

<sup>12</sup> “Kings and their armies flee in haste; she who waits at home divides the plunder. 

<sup>13</sup> Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her feathers with shimmering gold.” 

<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like the snow falling on Zalmon. 

<sup>15</sup> A mountain of God is Mount Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is Mount Bashan. 

<sup>16</sup> Why do you gaze in envy, O mountains of many peaks? This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling, where the LORD will surely dwell forever. 

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are tens of thousands— thousands of thousands are they; the Lord is in His sanctuary as He was at Sinai. 

<sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high; You have led captives away. You have received gifts from men, even from the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there. 

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, the God of our salvation. 

<sup>20</sup> Our God is a God of deliverance; the Lord GOD is our rescuer from death. 

<sup>21</sup> Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy crowns of those who persist in guilty ways. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, “I will retrieve them from Bashan, I will bring them up from the depths of the sea, 

<sup>23</sup> that your foot may be dipped in the blood of your foes— the tongues of your dogs in the same.” 

<sup>24</sup> They have seen Your procession, O God— the march of my God and King into the sanctuary. 

<sup>25</sup> The singers lead the way, the musicians follow after, among the maidens playing tambourines. 

<sup>26</sup> Bless God in the great congregation; bless the LORD from the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah in their company, the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> Summon Your power, O God; show Your strength, O God, which You have exerted on our behalf. 

<sup>29</sup> Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring You gifts. 

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations, until it submits, bringing bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war. 

<sup>31</sup> Envoys will arrive from Egypt; Cush will stretch out her hands to God. 

<sup>32</sup> Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord— 

<sup>33</sup> to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old; behold, His mighty voice resounds. 

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe the power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose strength is in the skies. 

<sup>35</sup> O God, You are awesome in Your sanctuary; the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be God!
