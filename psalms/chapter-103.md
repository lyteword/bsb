# Chapter 103

<sup>1</sup> Of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name. 

<sup>2</sup> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all His kind deeds— 

<sup>3</sup> He who forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases, 

<sup>4</sup> who redeems your life from the Pit and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion, 

<sup>5</sup> who satisfies you with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion. 

<sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse us, nor harbor His anger forever. 

<sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities. 

<sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him. 

<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. 

<sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him. 

<sup>14</sup> For He knows our frame; He is mindful that we are dust. 

<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass— he blooms like a flower of the field; 

<sup>16</sup> when the wind passes over, it vanishes, and its place remembers it no more. 

<sup>17</sup> But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children— 

<sup>18</sup> to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts. 

<sup>19</sup> The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all. 

<sup>20</sup> Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command. 

<sup>21</sup> Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will. 

<sup>22</sup> Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
