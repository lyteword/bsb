# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David. I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me. 

<sup>2</sup> O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol; You spared me from descending into the Pit. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing to the LORD, O you His saints, and praise His holy name. 

<sup>5</sup> For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the morning. 

<sup>6</sup> In prosperity I said, “I will never be shaken.” 

<sup>7</sup> O LORD, You favored me; You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was dismayed. 

<sup>8</sup> To You, O LORD, I called, and I begged my Lord for mercy: 

<sup>9</sup> “What gain is there in my bloodshed, in my descent to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your faithfulness? 

<sup>10</sup> Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy; O LORD, be my helper.” 

<sup>11</sup> You turned my mourning into dancing; You peeled off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, 

<sup>12</sup> that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks forever.
