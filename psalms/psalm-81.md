# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing for joy to God our strength; make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> Lift up a song, strike the tambourine, play the sweet-sounding harp and lyre. 

<sup>3</sup> Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and at the full moon on the day of our Feast. 

<sup>4</sup> For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt, where I heard an unfamiliar language: 

<sup>6</sup> “I relieved his shoulder of the burden; his hands were freed from the basket. 

<sup>7</sup> You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the cloud of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. 

<sup>8</sup> Hear, O My people, and I will warn you: O Israel, if only you would listen to Me! 

<sup>9</sup> There must be no strange god among you, nor shall you bow to a foreign god. 

<sup>10</sup> I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it. 

<sup>11</sup> But My people would not listen to Me, and Israel would not obey Me. 

<sup>12</sup> So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices. 

<sup>13</sup> If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My ways, 

<sup>14</sup> how soon I would subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes! 

<sup>15</sup> Those who hate the LORD would feign obedience, and their doom would last forever. 

<sup>16</sup> But I would feed you the finest wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
