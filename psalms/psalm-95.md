# Psalm 95

## Do Not Harden Your Hearts

**(Hebrews 3:7–11)**

<sup>1</sup> Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout to the Rock of our salvation!

<sup>2</sup> Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.

<sup>3</sup> For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods.

<sup>4</sup> In His hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.

<sup>5</sup> The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.

<sup>6</sup> O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.

<sup>7</sup> For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice,

<sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah,[^2345] in the day at Massah in the wilderness,[^2346]

<sup>9</sup> where your fathers tested and tried Me, though they had seen My work.

<sup>10</sup> For forty years I was angry with that generation, and I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray,[^2347] and they have not known My ways.”

<sup>11</sup> So I swore on oath in My anger, “They shall never enter My rest.”[^2348]
