# Chapter 73

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped. 

<sup>3</sup> For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed. 

<sup>5</sup> They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is their necklace; a garment of violence covers them. 

<sup>7</sup> From their prosperity proceeds iniquity; the imaginations of their hearts run wild. 

<sup>8</sup> They mock and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression. 

<sup>9</sup> They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues strut across the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> So their people return to this place and drink up waters in abundance. 

<sup>11</sup> The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?” 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked— always carefree as they increase their wealth. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; in innocence I have washed my hands. 

<sup>14</sup> For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning. 

<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak this way,” then I would have betrayed Your children. 

<sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand all this, it was troublesome in my sight 

<sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary; then I discerned their end. 

<sup>18</sup> Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin. 

<sup>19</sup> How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors! 

<sup>20</sup> Like one waking from a dream, so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form. 

<sup>21</sup> When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within, 

<sup>22</sup> I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You. 

<sup>23</sup> Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> You guide me with Your counsel, and later receive me in glory. 

<sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You. 

<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 

<sup>27</sup> Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You. 

<sup>28</sup> But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may proclaim all Your works.
