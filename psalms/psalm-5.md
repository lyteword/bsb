# Psalm 5

## Give Ear to My Words

For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.

**²** Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.

**³** In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation.

**⁴** For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.

**⁵** The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity.

**⁶** You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.

**⁷** But I will enter Your house by the abundance of Your loving devotion;[^2148] in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.

**⁸** Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.

**⁹** For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction lies within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.[^2149]

**¹⁰** Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.

**¹¹** But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.

**¹²** For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of Your favor.

[^2148]: 5:7 Forms of the Hebrew chesed are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as loving devotion; the range of meaning includes love, goodness, kindness, faithfulness, and mercy, as well as loyalty to a covenant.
[^2149]: 5:9 Or flattery; cited in Romans 3:13
