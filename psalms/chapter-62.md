# Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him. 

<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress; I will never be shaken. 

<sup>3</sup> How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence? 

<sup>4</sup> They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch; they delight in lies; with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. 

<sup>5</sup> Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him. 

<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress; I will not be shaken. 

<sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock; my refuge is in God. 

<sup>8</sup> Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. 

<sup>9</sup> Lowborn men are but a vapor, the exalted but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they go up; together they are but a vapor. 

<sup>10</sup> Place no trust in extortion, or false hope in stolen goods. If your riches increase, do not set your heart upon them. 

<sup>11</sup> God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God, 

<sup>12</sup> and loving devotion to You, O Lord. For You will repay each man according to his deeds.
