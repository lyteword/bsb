# Chapter 85

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity. 

<sup>2</sup> You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. 

<sup>3</sup> You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger. 

<sup>4</sup> Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us. 

<sup>5</sup> Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations? 

<sup>6</sup> Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You? 

<sup>7</sup> Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly. 

<sup>9</sup> Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed. 

<sup>11</sup> Faithfulness sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
