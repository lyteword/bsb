# Psalm 133

## How Pleasant to Live in Harmony!

**(1 Corinthians 1:10–17; Ephesians 4:1–16)**

A song of ascents. Of David.

<sup>1</sup> Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!

<sup>2</sup> It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron’s beard over the collar of his robes.

<sup>3</sup> It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing of life forevermore.
