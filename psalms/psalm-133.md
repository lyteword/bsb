# Psalm 133

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony! 

<sup>2</sup> It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaronâ€™s beard over the collar of his robes. 

<sup>3</sup> It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing of life forevermore.
