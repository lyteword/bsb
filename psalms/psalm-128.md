# Psalm 128

## The Blessed Fear of the LORD

**(Psalms 112:1–10)**

A song of ascents.

<sup>1</sup> Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in His ways!

<sup>2</sup> For when you eat the fruit of your labor, blessings and prosperity will be yours.

<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be like a fruitful vine flourishing within your house, your sons like olive shoots sitting around your table.

<sup>4</sup> In this way indeed shall blessing come to the man who fears the LORD.

<sup>5</sup> May the LORD bless you from Zion, that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,

<sup>6</sup> that you may see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel!
