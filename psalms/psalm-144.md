# Psalm 144

## Blessed Be the LORD, My Rock

Of David.

**¹** Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.

**²** He is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples [^2425] under me.

**³** O LORD, what is man, that You regard him, the son of man that You think of him?

**⁴** Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.

**⁵** Part Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke.

**⁶** Flash forth Your lightning and scatter them; shoot Your arrows and rout them.

**⁷** Reach down from on high; set me free and rescue me from the deep waters, from the grasp of foreigners,

**⁸** whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.

**⁹** I will sing to You a new song, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will make music to You—

**¹⁰** to Him who gives victory to kings, who frees His servant David from the deadly sword.

**¹¹** Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.

**¹²** Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars carved to adorn a palace.

**¹³** Our storehouses will be full, supplying all manner of produce; our flocks will bring forth thousands, tens of thousands in our fields.

**¹⁴** Our oxen will bear great loads.[^2426] There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our streets.

**¹⁵** Blessed are the people of whom this is so; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.

[^2425]: 144:2 Many Hebrew manuscripts, DSS, Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts subdues my people
[^2426]: 144:14 Or Our chieftains will be firmly established
