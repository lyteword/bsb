## I Will Exalt You, My God and King

A Psalm of praise. Of David.[^2427]

**¹** I will exalt You, my God and King; I will bless Your name forever and ever.

**²** Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.

**³** Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable.

**⁴** One generation will commend Your works to the next, and will proclaim Your mighty acts—

**⁵** the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works.

**⁶** They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds, and I will declare Your greatness.

**⁷** They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness and sing joyfully of Your righteousness.

**⁸** The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion.

**⁹** The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made.

**¹⁰** All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD, and Your saints will bless You.

**¹¹** They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom and speak of Your might,

**¹²** to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.

**¹³** Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions.[^2428]

**¹⁴** The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.

**¹⁵** The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season.

**¹⁶** You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

**¹⁷** The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds.

**¹⁸** The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call out to Him in truth.

**¹⁹** He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them.

**²⁰** The LORD preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.

**²¹** My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD; let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
