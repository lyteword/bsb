# Psalm 145

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of praise. Of David. I will exalt You, my God and King; I will bless Your name forever and ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable. 

<sup>4</sup> One generation will commend Your works to the next, and will proclaim Your mighty actsâ€” 

<sup>5</sup> the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works. 

<sup>6</sup> They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds, and I will declare Your greatness. 

<sup>7</sup> They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness and sing joyfully of Your righteousness. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made. 

<sup>10</sup> All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD, and Your saints will bless You. 

<sup>11</sup> They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom and speak of Your might, 

<sup>12</sup> to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom. 

<sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. 

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season. 

<sup>16</sup> You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing. 

<sup>17</sup> The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call out to Him in truth. 

<sup>19</sup> He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them. 

<sup>20</sup> The LORD preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy. 

<sup>21</sup> My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD; let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
