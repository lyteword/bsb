# Psalm 72

## Endow the King with Your Justice

**(1 Kings 3:1–15; 2 Chronicles 1:1–13; Psalms 45:1–17)**

Of Solomon.

**¹** Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness.

**²** May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.

**³** May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring righteousness.

**⁴** May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.

**⁵** May they fear him [^2297] as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations.

**⁶** May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.

**⁷** May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound until the moon is no more.

**⁸** May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates [^2298] to the ends of the earth.

**⁹** May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust.

**¹⁰** May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.

**¹¹** May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.

**¹²** For he will deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.

**¹³** He will take pity on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed.

**¹⁴** He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight.

**¹⁵** Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long.

**¹⁶** May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, the people of its cities like the grass of the field.

**¹⁷** May his name endure forever; may his name continue[^2299] as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed.

**¹⁸** Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.

**¹⁹** And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen.

**²⁰** Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.

[^2297]: 72:5 LXX He shall endure
[^2298]: 72:8 Hebrew the River
[^2299]: 72:17 Or increase
