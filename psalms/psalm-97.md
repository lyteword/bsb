# Psalm 97

## Let the Earth Rejoice

**¹** The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the distant shores be glad.

**²** Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne’s foundation.

**³** Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side.

**⁴** His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles.

**⁵** The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.

**⁶** The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory.

**⁷** All worshipers of images are put to shame— those who boast in idols. Worship Him, all you gods!

**⁸** Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments, O LORD.

**⁹** For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.

**¹⁰** Hate evil, O you who love the LORD! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

**¹¹** Light shines [^2349] on the righteous, gladness on the upright in heart.

**¹²** Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.

[^2349]: 97:11 One Hebrew manuscript, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts Light is sown
