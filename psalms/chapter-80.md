# Chapter 80

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph. Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth 

<sup>2</sup> before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your mighty power and come to save us. 

<sup>3</sup> Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved. 

<sup>4</sup> O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people? 

<sup>5</sup> You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink the full measure of their tears. 

<sup>6</sup> You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us. 

<sup>7</sup> Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved. 

<sup>8</sup> You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it. 

<sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches. 

<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River. 

<sup>12</sup> Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit? 

<sup>13</sup> The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it. 

<sup>14</sup> Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine— 

<sup>15</sup> the root Your right hand has planted, the son You have raised up for Yourself. 

<sup>16</sup> Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. 

<sup>17</sup> Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself. 

<sup>18</sup> Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name. 

<sup>19</sup> Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
