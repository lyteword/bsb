# Psalm 35

## Contend with My Opponents, O LORD

Of David.

<sup>1</sup> Contend with my opponents, O LORD; fight against those who fight against me.

<sup>2</sup> Take up Your shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.

<sup>3</sup> Draw the spear and javelin [^2218] against my pursuers; say to my soul: “I am your salvation.”

<sup>4</sup> May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plan to harm me be driven back and confounded.

<sup>5</sup> May they be like chaff in the wind, as the angel of the LORD drives them away.

<sup>6</sup> May their path be dark and slick, as the angel of the LORD pursues.

<sup>7</sup> For without cause they laid their net for me; without reason they dug a pit for my soul.

<sup>8</sup> May ruin befall them by surprise; may the net they hid ensnare them; may they fall into the hazard they created.

<sup>9</sup> Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and exult in His salvation.

<sup>10</sup> All my bones will exclaim, “Who is like You, O LORD, who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor, the poor and needy from the robber?”

<sup>11</sup> Hostile witnesses come forward; they make charges I know nothing about.

<sup>12</sup> They repay me evil for good, to the bereavement of my soul.

<sup>13</sup> Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth; I humbled myself with fasting, but my prayers returned unanswered.[^2219]

<sup>14</sup> I paced about as for my friend or brother; I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning for his mother.

<sup>15</sup> But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee; they gathered together against me. Assailants I did not know slandered me without ceasing.

<sup>16</sup> Like godless jesters at a feast,[^2220] they gnashed their teeth at me.

<sup>17</sup> How long, O Lord, will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.

<sup>18</sup> Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among many people.

<sup>19</sup> Let not my enemies gloat over me without cause, nor those who hate me without reason wink in malice.[^2221]

<sup>20</sup> For they do not speak peace, but they devise deceitful schemes against those who live quietly in the land.

<sup>21</sup> They gape at me and say, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!”

<sup>22</sup> O LORD, You have seen it; be not silent. O Lord, be not far from me.

<sup>23</sup> Awake and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord!

<sup>24</sup> Vindicate me by Your righteousness, O LORD my God, and do not let them gloat over me.

<sup>25</sup> Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha, just what we wanted!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up!”

<sup>26</sup> May those who gloat in my distress be ashamed and confounded; may those who exalt themselves over me be clothed in shame and reproach.

<sup>27</sup> May those who favor my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “Exalted be the LORD who delights in His servant’s well-being.”

<sup>28</sup> Then my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness and Your praises all day long.

[^2218]: 35:3 Or and close the way
[^2219]: 35:13 Literally returned to my bosom
[^2220]: 35:16 Or Like a godless circle of mockers,
[^2221]: 35:19 See John 15:25.
