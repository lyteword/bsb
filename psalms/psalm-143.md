# Psalm 143

## I Stretch Out My Hands to You

A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea; in Your righteousness, answer me.

<sup>2</sup> Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.

<sup>3</sup> For the enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life to the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.

<sup>4</sup> My spirit grows faint within me; my heart is dismayed inside me.

<sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I consider the work of Your hands.

<sup>6</sup> I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for You like a parched land. Selah

<sup>7</sup> Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who descend to the Pit.

<sup>8</sup> Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning, for I have put my trust in You. Teach me the way I should walk, for to You I lift up my soul.

<sup>9</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD; I flee to You for refuge.[^2424]

<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.

<sup>11</sup> For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.

<sup>12</sup> And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies. Destroy all who afflict me, for I am Your servant.
