# Psalm 118

## The LORD Is on My Side

**¹** Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

**²** Let Israel [^2390] say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

**³** Let the house of Aaron say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

**⁴** Let those who fear the LORD say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

**⁵** In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered and set me free.

**⁶** The LORD is on my side;[^2391] I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?[^2392]

**⁷** The LORD is on my side; He is my helper. Therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.

**⁸** It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.

**⁹** It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.

**¹⁰** All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

**¹¹** They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

**¹²** They swarmed around me like bees, but they were extinguished like burning thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

**¹³** I was pushed so hard I was falling, but the LORD helped me.

**¹⁴** The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation.

**¹⁵** Shouts of joy and salvation resound in the tents of the righteous: “The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!

**¹⁶** The right hand of the LORD is exalted! The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!”

**¹⁷** I will not die, but I will live and proclaim what the LORD has done.

**¹⁸** The LORD disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death.

**¹⁹** Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter and give thanks to the LORD.

**²⁰** This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.

**²¹** I will give You thanks, for You have answered me, and You have become my salvation.

**²²** The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.[^2393]

**²³** This is from the LORD, and it is marvelous in our eyes.[^2394]

**²⁴** This is the day that the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

**²⁵** O LORD, save us, we pray.[^2395] We beseech You, O LORD, cause us to prosper!

**²⁶** Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD.[^2396] From the house of the LORD we bless you.

**²⁷** The LORD is God; He has made His light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.[^2397]

**²⁸** You are my God, and I will give You thanks. You are my God, and I will exalt You.

**²⁹** Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
