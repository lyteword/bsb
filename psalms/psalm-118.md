# Psalm 118

## The LORD Is on My Side

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel [^2390] say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

<sup>4</sup> Let those who fear the LORD say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”

<sup>5</sup> In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered and set me free.

<sup>6</sup> The LORD is on my side;[^2391] I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?[^2392]

<sup>7</sup> The LORD is on my side; He is my helper. Therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.

<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.

<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.

<sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

<sup>11</sup> They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

<sup>12</sup> They swarmed around me like bees, but they were extinguished like burning thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

<sup>13</sup> I was pushed so hard I was falling, but the LORD helped me.

<sup>14</sup> The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation.

<sup>15</sup> Shouts of joy and salvation resound in the tents of the righteous: “The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of the LORD is exalted! The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!”

<sup>17</sup> I will not die, but I will live and proclaim what the LORD has done.

<sup>18</sup> The LORD disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death.

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter and give thanks to the LORD.

<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.

<sup>21</sup> I will give You thanks, for You have answered me, and You have become my salvation.

<sup>22</sup> The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.[^2393]

<sup>23</sup> This is from the LORD, and it is marvelous in our eyes.[^2394]

<sup>24</sup> This is the day that the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

<sup>25</sup> O LORD, save us, we pray.[^2395] We beseech You, O LORD, cause us to prosper!

<sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD.[^2396] From the house of the LORD we bless you.

<sup>27</sup> The LORD is God; He has made His light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.[^2397]

<sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give You thanks. You are my God, and I will exalt You.

<sup>29</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
