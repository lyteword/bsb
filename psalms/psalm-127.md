# Psalm 127

## Children Are a Heritage from the LORD

A song of ascents. Of Solomon.

**¹** Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain; unless the LORD protects the city, its watchmen stand guard in vain.

**²** In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for bread to eat— for He gives sleep to His beloved.

**³** Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward.

**⁴** Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one’s youth.

**⁵** Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
