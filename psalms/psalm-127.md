# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain; unless the LORD protects the city, its watchmen stand guard in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for bread to eat— for He gives sleep to His beloved. 

<sup>3</sup> Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward. 

<sup>4</sup> Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one’s youth. 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
