# Psalm 51

## Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God

**(2 Samuel 12:1–12)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him after his adultery with Bathsheba.

**¹** Have mercy on me,[^2256] O God, according to Your loving devotion; according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.

**²** Wash me clean of my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.

**³** For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.

**⁴** Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be proved right when You speak and blameless when You judge.[^2257]

**⁵** Surely I was brought forth in iniquity; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.

**⁶** Surely You desire truth in the inmost being; You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.

**⁷** Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

**⁸** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.

**⁹** Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.

**¹⁰** Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

**¹¹** Cast me not away from Your presence; take not Your Holy Spirit from me.

**¹²** Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.

**¹³** Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.

**¹⁴** Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.

**¹⁵** O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.

**¹⁶** For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.

**¹⁷** The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

**¹⁸** In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.

**¹⁹** Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.

[^2256]: 51:1 Or Be gracious to me
[^2257]: 51:4 LXX and victorious when You judge; cited in Romans 3:4
