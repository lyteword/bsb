# Psalm 146

## Praise the LORD, O My Soul

**¹** Hallelujah! [^2429] Praise the LORD, O my soul.

**²** I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.

**³** Put not your trust in princes, in mortal man, who cannot save.

**⁴** When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.

**⁵** Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,

**⁶** the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever.

**⁷** He executes justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free,

**⁸** the LORD opens the eyes of the blind, the LORD lifts those who are weighed down, the LORD loves the righteous.

**⁹** The LORD protects foreigners; He sustains the fatherless and the widow, but the ways of the wicked He frustrates.

**¹⁰** The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah!

[^2429]: 146:1 Or Hallelu YAH, meaning Praise the LORD; also in verse 10
