# Psalm 146

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Praise the LORD, O my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>3</sup> Put not your trust in princes, in mortal man, who cannot save. 

<sup>4</sup> When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish. 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 

<sup>6</sup> the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever. 

<sup>7</sup> He executes justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free, 

<sup>8</sup> the LORD opens the eyes of the blind, the LORD lifts those who are weighed down, the LORD loves the righteous. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD protects foreigners; He sustains the fatherless and the widow, but the ways of the wicked He frustrates. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah!
