# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders. 

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You. 

<sup>4</sup> For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously. 

<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished. 

<sup>7</sup> But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. 

<sup>10</sup> Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You. 

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>13</sup> Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Lift me up from the gates of death, 

<sup>14</sup> that I may declare all Your praises— that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden. 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. 

<sup>17</sup> The wicked will return to Sheol— all the nations who forget God. 

<sup>18</sup> For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed. 

<sup>19</sup> Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence. 

<sup>20</sup> Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men.
