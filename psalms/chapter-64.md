# Chapter 64

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice of complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of workers of iniquity, 

<sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows, 

<sup>4</sup> ambushing the innocent in seclusion, shooting suddenly, without fear. 

<sup>5</sup> They hold fast to their evil purpose; they speak of hiding their snares. “Who will see them?” they say. 

<sup>6</sup> They devise injustice and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” For the inner man and the heart are mysterious. 

<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> They will be made to stumble, their own tongues turned against them. All who see will shake their heads. 

<sup>9</sup> Then all mankind will fear and proclaim the work of God; so they will ponder what He has done. 

<sup>10</sup> Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; let all the upright in heart exult.
