# Psalm 76

## God’s Name Is Great in Israel

For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A song.

**¹** God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.

**²** His tent is in Salem,[^2307] His dwelling place in Zion.

**³** There He shattered the flaming arrows, the shield and sword and weapons of war. Selah

**⁴** You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains filled with game.

**⁵** The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand.

**⁶** At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.

**⁷** You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?

**⁸** From heaven You pronounced judgment, and the earth feared and was still

**⁹** when God rose up to judge, to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah

**¹⁰** Even the wrath of man shall praise You; with the survivors of wrath You will clothe Yourself.[^2308]

**¹¹** Make and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God; let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him who is to be feared.

**¹²** He breaks the spirits of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.

[^2307]: 76:2 That is, Jerusalem
[^2308]: 76:10 Or Surely Your wrath against men brings You praise, and the survivors of Your wrath will be restrained.
