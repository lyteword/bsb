# Psalm 64

## The Hurtful Tongue

**(James 3:1–12)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** Hear, O God, my voice of complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.

**²** Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of workers of iniquity,

**³** who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows,

**⁴** ambushing the innocent in seclusion, shooting suddenly, without fear.

**⁵** They hold fast to their evil purpose; they speak of hiding their snares. “Who will see them?” they say.

**⁶** They devise injustice and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” For the inner man and the heart are mysterious.

**⁷** But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be wounded.

**⁸** They will be made to stumble, their own tongues turned against them. All who see will shake their heads.

**⁹** Then all mankind will fear and proclaim the work of God; so they will ponder what He has done.

**¹⁰** Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; let all the upright in heart exult.
