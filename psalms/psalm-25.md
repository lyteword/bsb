# Psalm 25

## To You I Lift Up My Soul

Of David.[^2196]

**¹** To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul;

**²** in You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.

**³** Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who engage in treachery without cause will be disgraced.

**⁴** Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.

**⁵** Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You.

**⁶** Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion, for they are from age to age.

**⁷** Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellious acts; remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness, O LORD.

**⁸** Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way.

**⁹** He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.

**¹⁰** All the LORD’s ways are loving and faithful to those who keep His covenant and His decrees.

**¹¹** For the sake of Your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great.

**¹²** Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the path chosen for him.

**¹³** His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.

**¹⁴** The LORD confides in those who fear Him, and reveals His covenant to them.

**¹⁵** My eyes are always on the LORD, for He will free my feet from the mesh.

**¹⁶** Turn to me and be gracious, for I am lonely and afflicted.

**¹⁷** The troubles of my heart increase; free me from my distress.

**¹⁸** Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins.

**¹⁹** Consider my enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with vicious hatred.

**²⁰** Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.

**²¹** May integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for You.[^2197]

**²²** Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
