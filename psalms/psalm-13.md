# Psalm 13

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 

<sup>2</sup> How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me? 

<sup>3</sup> Consider me and respond, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death, 

<sup>4</sup> lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,” and my foes rejoice when I fall. 

<sup>5</sup> But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> I will sing to the LORD, for He has been good to me.
