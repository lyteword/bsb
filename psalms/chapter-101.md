# Chapter 101

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. I will sing of Your loving devotion and justice; to You, O LORD, I will sing praises. 

<sup>2</sup> I will ponder the way that is blamelessâ€” when will You come to me? I will walk in my house with integrity of heart. 

<sup>3</sup> I will set no worthless thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me. 

<sup>4</sup> A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know nothing of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not endure. 

<sup>6</sup> My eyes favor the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way of integrity shall minister to me. 

<sup>7</sup> No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who tells lies shall stand in my presence. 

<sup>8</sup> Every morning I will remove all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
