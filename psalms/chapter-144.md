# Chapter 144

<sup>1</sup> Of David. Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. 

<sup>2</sup> He is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD, what is man, that You regard him, the son of man that You think of him? 

<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow. 

<sup>5</sup> Part Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> Flash forth Your lightning and scatter them; shoot Your arrows and rout them. 

<sup>7</sup> Reach down from on high; set me free and rescue me from the deep waters, from the grasp of foreigners, 

<sup>8</sup> whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful. 

<sup>9</sup> I will sing to You a new song, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will make music to Youâ€” 

<sup>10</sup> to Him who gives victory to kings, who frees His servant David from the deadly sword. 

<sup>11</sup> Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful. 

<sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars carved to adorn a palace. 

<sup>13</sup> Our storehouses will be full, supplying all manner of produce; our flocks will bring forth thousands, tens of thousands in our fields. 

<sup>14</sup> Our oxen will bear great loads. There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our streets. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people of whom this is so; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.
