# Psalm 83

## O God, Be Not Silent

A song. A Psalm of Asaph.

**¹** O God, be not silent; be not speechless;[^2325] be not still, O God.

**²** See how Your enemies rage, how Your foes have reared their heads.

**³** With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish,

**⁴** saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more.”

**⁵** For with one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against You—

**⁶** the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,

**⁷** of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, of Philistia with the people of Tyre.

**⁸** Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah

**⁹** Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,

**¹⁰** who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.

**¹¹** Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,

**¹²** who said, “Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.”

**¹³** Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.

**¹⁴** As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze,

**¹⁵** so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.

**¹⁶** Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.

**¹⁷** May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace.

**¹⁸** May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
