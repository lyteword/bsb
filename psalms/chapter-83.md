# Chapter 83

<sup>1</sup> A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, be not silent; be not speechless; be not still, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> See how Your enemies rage, how Your foes have reared their heads. 

<sup>3</sup> With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish, 

<sup>4</sup> saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more.” 

<sup>5</sup> For with one mind they plot together, they form an alliance against You— 

<sup>6</sup> the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites, 

<sup>7</sup> of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, of Philistia with the people of Tyre. 

<sup>8</sup> Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. 

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon, 

<sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground. 

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

<sup>12</sup> who said, “Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.” 

<sup>13</sup> Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind. 

<sup>14</sup> As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze, 

<sup>15</sup> so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm. 

<sup>16</sup> Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace. 

<sup>18</sup> May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
