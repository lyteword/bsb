# Psalm 59

## Deliver Me from My Enemies

**(1 Samuel 19:1–24)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam [^2274] of David, when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him.

**¹** Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.

**²** Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed.

**³** See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD.

**⁴** For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice.

**⁵** O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah

**⁶** They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.

**⁷** See what they spew from their mouths— sharp words from their lips: “For who can hear us?”

**⁸** But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.

**⁹** I will keep watch for You, O my strength, because You, O God, are my fortress.

**¹⁰** My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes.

**¹¹** Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.

**¹²** By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter.

**¹³** Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah

**¹⁴** They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.

**¹⁵** They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.

**¹⁶** But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.

**¹⁷** To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.

[^2274]: 59:0 Miktam is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 16 and 56–60.
