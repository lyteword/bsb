# Psalm 108

## Israel’s Kingdom Blessing

**(Psalms 57:1–11; Psalms 60:1–12)**

A song. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my being.[^2373]

<sup>2</sup> Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.

<sup>3</sup> I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.

<sup>4</sup> For Your loving devotion extends beyond the heavens, and Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered.

<sup>7</sup> God has spoken from His sanctuary:[^2374] “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter.

<sup>9</sup> Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”

<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

<sup>11</sup> Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?

<sup>12</sup> Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.

<sup>13</sup> With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.

[^2373]: 108:1 Or with my glory
[^2374]: 108:7 Or in His holiness
