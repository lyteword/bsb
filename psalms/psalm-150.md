**²** Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His excellent greatness.

**³** Praise Him with the sound of the horn; praise Him with the harp and lyre.

**⁵** Praise Him with clashing cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals.

**⁶** Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelujah!
