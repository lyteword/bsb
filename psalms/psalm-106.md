# Psalm 106

## Give Thanks to the LORD, for He Is Good

**¹** Hallelujah! [^2363] Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

**²** Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise?

**³** Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.

**⁴** Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation,

**⁵** that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance.

**⁶** We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.

**⁷** Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea.[^2364]

**⁸** Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known.

**⁹** He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.

**¹⁰** He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

**¹¹** The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained.

**¹²** Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.

**¹³** Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel.

**¹⁴** They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.

**¹⁵** So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them.

**¹⁶** In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.

**¹⁷** The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.

**¹⁸** Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked.

**¹⁹** At Horeb [^2365] they made a calf and worshiped a molten image.

**²⁰** They exchanged their Glory [^2366] for the image of a grass-eating ox.

**²¹** They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,

**²²** wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.

**²³** So He said He would destroy them— had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them.

**²⁴** They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.

**²⁵** They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.

**²⁶** So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,

**²⁷** to disperse [^2367] their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.

**²⁸** They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.

**²⁹** So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.

**³⁰** But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained.

**³¹** It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.

**³²** At the waters of Meribah [^2368] they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them.

**³³** For they rebelled against His Spirit,[^2369] and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.

**³⁴** They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,

**³⁵** but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.

**³⁶** They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.

**³⁷** They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.

**³⁸** They shed innocent blood— the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.

**³⁹** They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.

**⁴⁰** So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.

**⁴¹** He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.

**⁴²** Their enemies oppressed them and subdued them under their hand.

**⁴³** Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity.

**⁴⁴** Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress.

**⁴⁵** And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.

**⁴⁶** He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.

**⁴⁷** Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.

**⁴⁸** Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
