# Psalm 106

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise? 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times. 

<sup>4</sup> Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation, 

<sup>5</sup> that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance. 

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known. 

<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert. 

<sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained. 

<sup>12</sup> Then they believed His promises and sang His praise. 

<sup>13</sup> Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel. 

<sup>14</sup> They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert. 

<sup>15</sup> So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them. 

<sup>16</sup> In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped a molten image. 

<sup>20</sup> They exchanged their Glory for the image of a grass-eating ox. 

<sup>21</sup> They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt, 

<sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> So He said He would destroy them— had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them. 

<sup>24</sup> They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise. 

<sup>25</sup> They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD. 

<sup>26</sup> So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness, 

<sup>27</sup> to disperse their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. 

<sup>28</sup> They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods. 

<sup>29</sup> So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 

<sup>30</sup> But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained. 

<sup>31</sup> It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. 

<sup>32</sup> At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them. 

<sup>33</sup> For they rebelled against His Spirit, and Moses spoke rashly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them, 

<sup>35</sup> but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. 

<sup>36</sup> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. 

<sup>37</sup> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. 

<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood— the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood. 

<sup>39</sup> They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds. 

<sup>40</sup> So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance. 

<sup>41</sup> He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand. 

<sup>43</sup> Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress. 

<sup>45</sup> And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion. 

<sup>46</sup> He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive. 

<sup>47</sup> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise. 

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
