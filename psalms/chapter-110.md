# Chapter 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.” 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD extends Your mighty scepter from Zion: “Rule in the midst of Your enemies.” 

<sup>3</sup> Your people shall be willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, to You belongs the dew of Your youth. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” 

<sup>5</sup> The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings in the day of His wrath. 

<sup>6</sup> He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead; He will crush the leaders far and wide. 

<sup>7</sup> He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore He will lift up His head.
