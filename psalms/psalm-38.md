# Psalm 38

## Do Not Rebuke Me in Your Anger

**(Psalms 6:1–10)**

A Psalm of David, for remembrance.

**¹** O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.

**²** For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me.

**³** There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger; there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.

**⁴** For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.

**⁵** My wounds are foul and festering because of my sinful folly.

**⁶** I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.

**⁷** For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body.

**⁸** I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.

**⁹** O Lord, my every desire is before You; my groaning is not hidden from You.

**¹⁰** My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded.

**¹¹** My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance.

**¹²** Those who seek my life lay snares; those who wish me harm speak destruction, plotting deceit all day long.

**¹³** But like a deaf man, I do not hear; and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth.

**¹⁴** I am like a man who cannot hear, whose mouth offers no reply.

**¹⁵** I wait for You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God.

**¹⁶** For I said, “Let them not gloat over me— those who taunt me when my foot slips.”

**¹⁷** For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.

**¹⁸** Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.

**¹⁹** Many are my enemies without cause,[^2227] and many hate me without reason.[^2228]

**²⁰** Those who repay my good with evil attack me for pursuing the good.

**²¹** Do not forsake me, O LORD; be not far from me, O my God.

**²²** Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.
