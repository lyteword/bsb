# Chapter 102

<sup>1</sup> A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come before You. 

<sup>2</sup> Do not hide Your face from me in my day of distress. Incline Your ear to me; answer me quickly when I call. 

<sup>3</sup> For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my bread. 

<sup>5</sup> Through my loud groaning my flesh clings to my bones. 

<sup>6</sup> I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins. 

<sup>7</sup> I lie awake; I am like a lone bird on a housetop. 

<sup>8</sup> All day long my enemies taunt me; they ridicule me and curse me. 

<sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears 

<sup>10</sup> because of Your indignation and wrath, for You have picked me up and cast me aside. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are like lengthening shadows, and I wither away like grass. 

<sup>12</sup> But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures to all generations. 

<sup>13</sup> You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor— the appointed time has come. 

<sup>14</sup> For Your servants delight in her stones and take pity on her dust. 

<sup>15</sup> So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory. 

<sup>16</sup> For the LORD will rebuild Zion; He has appeared in His glory. 

<sup>17</sup> He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their prayer. 

<sup>18</sup> Let this be written for the generation to come, so that a people not yet created may praise the LORD. 

<sup>19</sup> For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth 

<sup>20</sup> to hear a prisoner’s groaning, to release those condemned to death, 

<sup>21</sup> that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion and praise Him in Jerusalem, 

<sup>22</sup> when peoples and kingdoms assemble to serve the LORD. 

<sup>23</sup> He has broken my strength on the way; He has cut short my days. 

<sup>24</sup> I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days! Your years go on through all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. 

<sup>26</sup> They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on. 

<sup>27</sup> But You remain the same, and Your years will never end. 

<sup>28</sup> The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You.”
