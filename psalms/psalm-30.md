# Psalm 30

## You Turned My Mourning into Dancing

A Psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David.

**¹** I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.

**²** O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.

**³** O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol; You spared me from descending into the Pit.

**⁴** Sing to the LORD, O you His saints, and praise His holy name.[^2204]

**⁵** For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the morning.

**⁶** In prosperity I said, “I will never be shaken.”

**⁷** O LORD, You favored me; You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was dismayed.

**⁸** To You, O LORD, I called, and I begged my Lord for mercy:

**⁹** “What gain is there in my bloodshed,[^2205] in my descent to the Pit?[^2206] Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?

**¹⁰** Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy; O LORD, be my helper.”

**¹¹** You turned my mourning into dancing; You peeled off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,

**¹²** that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks forever.

[^2204]: 30:4 Or and praise the memorial of His holiness; see Exodus 3:15.
[^2205]: 30:9 Or in my destruction
[^2206]: 30:9 Or to corruption
