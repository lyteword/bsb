# Chapter 92

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. It is good to praise the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High, 

<sup>2</sup> to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning and Your faithfulness at night 

<sup>3</sup> with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre. 

<sup>4</sup> For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds; I sing for joy at the works of Your hands. 

<sup>5</sup> How great are Your works, O LORD, how deep are Your thoughts! 

<sup>6</sup> A senseless man does not know, and a fool does not understand, 

<sup>7</sup> that though the wicked sprout like grass, and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed. 

<sup>8</sup> But You, O LORD, are exalted forever! 

<sup>9</sup> For surely Your enemies, O LORD, surely Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered. 

<sup>10</sup> But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; with fine oil I have been anointed. 

<sup>11</sup> My eyes see the downfall of my enemies; my ears hear the wailing of my wicked foes. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

<sup>13</sup> Planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God. 

<sup>14</sup> In old age they will still bear fruit; healthy and green they will remain, 

<sup>15</sup> to proclaim, “The LORD is upright; He is my Rock, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.”
