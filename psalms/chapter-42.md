# Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul longs after You, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, the living God. When shall I come and appear in God’s presence? 

<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food both day and night, while men ask me all day long, “Where is your God?” 

<sup>4</sup> These things come to mind as I pour out my soul: how I walked with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God with shouts of joy and praise. 

<sup>5</sup> Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence. 

<sup>6</sup> O my God, my soul despairs within me. Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon— even from Mount Mizar. 

<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and waves have rolled over me. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day, and at night His song is with me as a prayer to the God of my life. 

<sup>9</sup> I say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?” 

<sup>10</sup> Like the crushing of my bones, my enemies taunt me, while they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?” 

<sup>11</sup> Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
