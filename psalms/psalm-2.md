# Psalm 2

## The Triumphant Messiah

**(Acts 4:23–31)**

<sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage [^2140] and the peoples plot in vain?

<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:[^2141]

<sup>3</sup> “Let us break Their chains and cast away Their cords.”

<sup>4</sup> The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord taunts them.

<sup>5</sup> Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them in His fury:

<sup>6</sup> “I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy mountain.”

<sup>7</sup> I will proclaim the decree spoken to Me by the LORD: “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.[^2142]

<sup>8</sup> Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession.

<sup>9</sup> You will break them [^2143] with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery.[^2144]”

<sup>10</sup> Therefore be wise, O kings; be admonished, O judges of the earth.

<sup>11</sup> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

<sup>12</sup> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, when His wrath ignites in an instant. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
