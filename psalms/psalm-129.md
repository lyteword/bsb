# Psalm 129

## The Cords of the Wicked

A song of ascents.

**¹** Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth— let Israel now declare—

**²** many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed against me.

**³** The plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.

**⁴** The LORD is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the wicked.

**⁵** May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.

**⁶** May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow,

**⁷** unable to fill the hands of the reaper, or the arms of the binder of sheaves.

**⁸** May none who pass by say to them, “The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.”
