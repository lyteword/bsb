# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A song of ascents. Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth— let Israel now declare— 

<sup>2</sup> many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed against me. 

<sup>3</sup> The plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. 

<sup>6</sup> May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow, 

<sup>7</sup> unable to fill the hands of the reaper, or the arms of the binder of sheaves. 

<sup>8</sup> May none who pass by say to them, “The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.”
