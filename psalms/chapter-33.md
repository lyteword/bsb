# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones; it is fitting for the upright to praise Him. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to Him with ten strings. 

<sup>3</sup> Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy. 

<sup>4</sup> For the word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His loving devotion. 

<sup>6</sup> By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> He piles up the waters of the sea; He puts the depths into storehouses. 

<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him. 

<sup>9</sup> For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples. 

<sup>11</sup> The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the purposes of His heart to all generations. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance! 

<sup>13</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men. 

<sup>14</sup> From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth. 

<sup>15</sup> He shapes the hearts of each; He considers all their works. 

<sup>16</sup> No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by his great strength. 

<sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain hope for salvation; even its great strength cannot save. 

<sup>18</sup> Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His loving devotion 

<sup>19</sup> to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. 

<sup>20</sup> Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield. 

<sup>21</sup> For our hearts rejoice in Him, since we trust in His holy name. 

<sup>22</sup> May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, as we put our hope in You.
