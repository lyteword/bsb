# Chapter 54

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. When the Ziphites went to Saul and said, “Is David not hiding among us?” Save me, O God, by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might! 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> For strangers rise up against me, and ruthless men seek my life— men with no regard for God. 

<sup>4</sup> Surely God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> He will reward my enemies with evil. In Your faithfulness, destroy them. 

<sup>6</sup> Freely I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> For He has delivered me from every trouble, and my eyes have stared down my foes.
