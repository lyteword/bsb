# Psalm 77

## In the Day of Trouble I Sought the Lord

For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.

**¹** I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.

**²** In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.

**³** I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah

**⁴** You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.

**⁵** I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.

**⁶** At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:

**⁷** “Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?

**⁸** Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?

**⁹** Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah

**¹⁰** So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”[^2309]

**¹¹** I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.

**¹²** I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.

**¹³** Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?

**¹⁴** You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples.

**¹⁵** With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

**¹⁶** The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken.

**¹⁷** The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth.

**¹⁸** Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.

**¹⁹** Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.[^2310]

**²⁰** You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

[^2309]: 77:10 Or “To this I will appeal: to the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
[^2310]: 77:19 Or were unknown
