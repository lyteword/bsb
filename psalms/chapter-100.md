<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Serve the LORD with gladness; come into His presence with joyful songs. 

<sup>3</sup> Know that the LORD is God. It is He who made us, and we are His; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. 

<sup>4</sup> Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name. 

<sup>5</sup> For the LORD is good, and His loving devotion endures forever; His faithfulness continues to all generations.
