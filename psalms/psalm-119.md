# Psalm 119

<sup>1</sup> Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Blessed are those who keep His testimonies and seek Him with all their heart. 

<sup>3</sup> They do no iniquity; they walk in His ways. 

<sup>4</sup> You have ordained Your precepts, that we should keep them diligently. 

<sup>5</sup> Oh, that my ways were committed to keeping Your statutes! 

<sup>6</sup> Then I would not be ashamed when I consider all Your commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> I will praise You with an upright heart when I learn Your righteous judgments. 

<sup>8</sup> I will keep Your statutes; do not utterly forsake me. 

<sup>9</sup> How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word. 

<sup>10</sup> With all my heart I have sought You; do not let me stray from Your commandments. 

<sup>11</sup> I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed are You, O LORD; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>13</sup> With my lips I proclaim all the judgments of Your mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches. 

<sup>15</sup> I will meditate on Your precepts and regard Your ways. 

<sup>16</sup> I will delight in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word. 

<sup>17</sup> Deal bountifully with Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word. 

<sup>18</sup> Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things from Your law. 

<sup>19</sup> I am a stranger on the earth; do not hide Your commandments from me. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul is consumed with longing for Your judgments at all times. 

<sup>21</sup> You rebuke the arrogant— the cursed who stray from Your commandments. 

<sup>22</sup> Remove my scorn and contempt, for I have kept Your testimonies. 

<sup>23</sup> Though rulers sit and slander me, Your servant meditates on Your statutes. 

<sup>24</sup> Your testimonies are indeed my delight; they are my counselors. 

<sup>25</sup> My soul cleaves to the dust; revive me according to Your word. 

<sup>26</sup> I recounted my ways, and You answered me; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>27</sup> Make clear to me the way of Your precepts; then I will meditate on Your wonders. 

<sup>28</sup> My soul melts with sorrow; strengthen me according to Your word. 

<sup>29</sup> Remove me from the path of deceit and graciously grant me Your law. 

<sup>30</sup> I have chosen the way of truth; I have set Your ordinances before me. 

<sup>31</sup> I cling to Your testimonies, O LORD; let me not be put to shame. 

<sup>32</sup> I run in the path of Your commandments, for You will enlarge my heart. 

<sup>33</sup> Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes, and I will keep them to the end. 

<sup>34</sup> Give me understanding that I may obey Your law, and follow it with all my heart. 

<sup>35</sup> Direct me in the path of Your commandments, for there I find delight. 

<sup>36</sup> Turn my heart to Your testimonies and not to covetous gain. 

<sup>37</sup> Turn my eyes away from worthless things; revive me with Your word. 

<sup>38</sup> Establish Your word to Your servant, to produce reverence for You. 

<sup>39</sup> Turn away the disgrace I dread, for Your judgments are good. 

<sup>40</sup> How I long for Your precepts! Revive me in Your righteousness. 

<sup>41</sup> May Your loving devotion come to me, O LORD, Your salvation, according to Your promise. 

<sup>42</sup> Then I can answer him who taunts, for I trust in Your word. 

<sup>43</sup> Never take Your word of truth from my mouth, for I hope in Your judgments. 

<sup>44</sup> I will always obey Your law, forever and ever. 

<sup>45</sup> And I will walk in freedom, for I have sought Your precepts. 

<sup>46</sup> I will speak of Your testimonies before kings, and I will not be ashamed. 

<sup>47</sup> I delight in Your commandments because I love them. 

<sup>48</sup> I lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love, and I meditate on Your statutes. 

<sup>49</sup> Remember Your word to Your servant, upon which You have given me hope. 

<sup>50</sup> This is my comfort in affliction, that Your promise has given me life. 

<sup>51</sup> The arrogant utterly deride me, but I do not turn from Your law. 

<sup>52</sup> I remember Your judgments of old, O LORD, and in them I find comfort. 

<sup>53</sup> Rage has taken hold of me because of the wicked who reject Your law. 

<sup>54</sup> Your statutes are songs to me in the house of my pilgrimage. 

<sup>55</sup> In the night, O LORD, I remember Your name, that I may keep Your law. 

<sup>56</sup> This is my practice, for I obey Your precepts. 

<sup>57</sup> The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep Your words. 

<sup>58</sup> I have sought Your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your promise. 

<sup>59</sup> I considered my ways and turned my steps to Your testimonies. 

<sup>60</sup> I hurried without hesitating to keep Your commandments. 

<sup>61</sup> Though the ropes of the wicked bind me, I do not forget Your law. 

<sup>62</sup> At midnight I rise to give You thanks for Your righteous judgments. 

<sup>63</sup> I am a friend to all who fear You, and to those who keep Your precepts. 

<sup>64</sup> The earth is filled with Your loving devotion, O LORD; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>65</sup> You are good to Your servant, O LORD, according to Your word. 

<sup>66</sup> Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in Your commandments. 

<sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I keep Your word. 

<sup>68</sup> You are good, and You do what is good; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>69</sup> Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, I keep Your precepts with all my heart. 

<sup>70</sup> Their hearts are hard and callous, but I delight in Your law. 

<sup>71</sup> It was good for me to be afflicted, that I might learn Your statutes. 

<sup>72</sup> The law from Your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver. 

<sup>73</sup> Your hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding to learn Your commandments. 

<sup>74</sup> May those who fear You see me and rejoice, for I have hoped in Your word. 

<sup>75</sup> I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me. 

<sup>76</sup> May Your loving devotion comfort me, I pray, according to Your promise to Your servant. 

<sup>77</sup> May Your compassion come to me, that I may live, for Your law is my delight. 

<sup>78</sup> May the arrogant be put to shame for subverting me with a lie; I will meditate on Your precepts. 

<sup>79</sup> May those who fear You turn to me, those who know Your testimonies. 

<sup>80</sup> May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, that I may not be put to shame. 

<sup>81</sup> My soul faints for Your salvation; I wait for Your word. 

<sup>82</sup> My eyes fail, looking for Your promise; I ask, “When will You comfort me?” 

<sup>83</sup> Though I am like a wineskin dried up by smoke, I do not forget Your statutes. 

<sup>84</sup> How many days must Your servant wait? When will You execute judgment on my persecutors? 

<sup>85</sup> The arrogant have dug pits for me in violation of Your law. 

<sup>86</sup> All Your commandments are faithful; I am persecuted without cause—help me! 

<sup>87</sup> They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken Your precepts. 

<sup>88</sup> Revive me according to Your loving devotion, that I may obey the testimony of Your mouth. 

<sup>89</sup> Your word, O LORD, is everlasting; it is firmly fixed in the heavens. 

<sup>90</sup> Your faithfulness continues through all generations; You established the earth, and it endures. 

<sup>91</sup> Your ordinances stand to this day, for all things are servants to You. 

<sup>92</sup> If Your law had not been my delight, then I would have perished in my affliction. 

<sup>93</sup> I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have revived me. 

<sup>94</sup> I am Yours; save me, for I have sought Your precepts. 

<sup>95</sup> The wicked wait to destroy me, but I will ponder Your testimonies. 

<sup>96</sup> I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is without limit. 

<sup>97</sup> Oh, how I love Your law! All day long it is my meditation. 

<sup>98</sup> Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for they are always with me. 

<sup>99</sup> I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation. 

<sup>100</sup> I discern more than the elders, for I obey Your precepts. 

<sup>101</sup> I have kept my feet from every evil path, that I may keep Your word. 

<sup>102</sup> I have not departed from Your ordinances, for You Yourself have taught me. 

<sup>103</sup> How sweet are Your words to my taste— sweeter than honey in my mouth! 

<sup>104</sup> I gain understanding from Your precepts; therefore I hate every false way. 

<sup>105</sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. 

<sup>106</sup> I have sworn and confirmed that I will keep Your righteous judgments. 

<sup>107</sup> I am severely afflicted, O LORD; revive me through Your word. 

<sup>108</sup> Accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me Your judgments. 

<sup>109</sup> I constantly take my life in my hands, yet I do not forget Your law. 

<sup>110</sup> The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from Your precepts. 

<sup>111</sup> Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart. 

<sup>112</sup> I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes, even to the very end. 

<sup>113</sup> The double-minded I despise, but Your law I love. 

<sup>114</sup> You are my hiding place and my shield; I put my hope in Your word. 

<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may obey the commandments of my God. 

<sup>116</sup> Sustain me as You promised, that I may live; let me not be ashamed of my hope. 

<sup>117</sup> Uphold me, and I will be saved, that I may always regard Your statutes. 

<sup>118</sup> You reject all who stray from Your statutes, for their deceitfulness is in vain. 

<sup>119</sup> All the wicked on earth You discard like dross; therefore I love Your testimonies. 

<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembles in awe of You; I stand in fear of Your judgments. 

<sup>121</sup> I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors. 

<sup>122</sup> Ensure Your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me. 

<sup>123</sup> My eyes fail, looking for Your salvation, and for Your righteous promise. 

<sup>124</sup> Deal with Your servant according to Your loving devotion, and teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>125</sup> I am Your servant; give me understanding, that I may know Your testimonies. 

<sup>126</sup> It is time for the LORD to act, for they have broken Your law. 

<sup>127</sup> Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold, even the purest gold. 

<sup>128</sup> Therefore I admire all Your precepts and hate every false way. 

<sup>129</sup> Wonderful are Your testimonies; therefore I obey them. 

<sup>130</sup> The unfolding of Your words gives light; it informs the simple. 

<sup>131</sup> I open my mouth and pant, longing for Your commandments. 

<sup>132</sup> Turn to me and show me mercy, as You do to those who love Your name. 

<sup>133</sup> Order my steps in Your word; let no sin rule over me. 

<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man, that I may keep Your precepts. 

<sup>135</sup> Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>136</sup> My eyes shed streams of tears because Your law is not obeyed. 

<sup>137</sup> Righteous are You, O LORD, and upright are Your judgments. 

<sup>138</sup> The testimonies You have laid down are righteous and altogether faithful. 

<sup>139</sup> My zeal has consumed me because my foes forget Your words. 

<sup>140</sup> Your promise is completely pure; therefore Your servant loves it. 

<sup>141</sup> I am lowly and despised, but I do not forget Your precepts. 

<sup>142</sup> Your righteousness is everlasting and Your law is true. 

<sup>143</sup> Trouble and distress have found me, but Your commandments are my delight. 

<sup>144</sup> Your testimonies are righteous forever. Give me understanding, that I may live.

<sup>148</sup> My eyes anticipate the watches of night, that I may meditate on Your word. 

<sup>149</sup> Hear my voice, O LORD, according to Your loving devotion; give me life according to Your justice. 

<sup>150</sup> Those who follow after wickedness draw near; they are far from Your law. 

<sup>151</sup> You are near, O LORD, and all Your commandments are true. 

<sup>152</sup> Long ago I learned from Your testimonies that You have established them forever. 

<sup>153</sup> Look upon my affliction and rescue me, for I have not forgotten Your law.
