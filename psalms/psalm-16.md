# Psalm 16

## The Presence of the LORD

**(Acts 2:14–36)**

A Miktam [^2167] of David.

<sup>1</sup> Preserve me, O God, for in You I take refuge.

<sup>2</sup> I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from You I have no good thing.”

<sup>3</sup> As for the saints in the land, they are the excellence in whom all my delight resides.

<sup>4</sup> Sorrows will multiply to those who chase other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood, or speak their names with my lips.

<sup>5</sup> The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You have made my lot secure.

<sup>6</sup> The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; surely my inheritance is delightful.

<sup>7</sup> I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my conscience instructs me.[^2168]

<sup>8</sup> I have set [^2169] the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will dwell securely.[^2170]

<sup>10</sup> For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.[^2171]

<sup>11</sup> You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence,[^2172] with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
