# Psalm 16

## The Presence of the LORD

**(Acts 2:14–36)**

A Miktam [^2167] of David.

**¹** Preserve me, O God, for in You I take refuge.

**²** I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from You I have no good thing.”

**³** As for the saints in the land, they are the excellence in whom all my delight resides.

**⁴** Sorrows will multiply to those who chase other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood, or speak their names with my lips.

**⁵** The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You have made my lot secure.

**⁶** The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; surely my inheritance is delightful.

**⁷** I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my conscience instructs me.[^2168]

**⁸** I have set [^2169] the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

**⁹** Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will dwell securely.[^2170]

**¹⁰** For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.[^2171]

**¹¹** You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence,[^2172] with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
