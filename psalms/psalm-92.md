# Psalm 92

## How Great Are Your Works!

A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.

**¹** It is good to praise the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High,

**²** to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning and Your faithfulness at night

**³** with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre.

**⁴** For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds; I sing for joy at the works of Your hands.

**⁵** How great are Your works, O LORD, how deep are Your thoughts!

**⁶** A senseless man does not know, and a fool does not understand,

**⁷** that though the wicked sprout like grass, and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.

**⁸** But You, O LORD, are exalted forever!

**⁹** For surely Your enemies, O LORD, surely Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.

**¹⁰** But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; with fine oil I have been anointed.

**¹¹** My eyes see the downfall of my enemies; my ears hear the wailing of my wicked foes.[^2342]

**¹²** The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

**¹³** Planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

**¹⁴** In old age they will still bear fruit; healthy and green they will remain,

**¹⁵** to proclaim, “The LORD is upright; He is my Rock, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.”

[^2342]: 92:11 Or my ears hear evildoers when they rise against me
