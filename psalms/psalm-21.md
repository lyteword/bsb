# Psalm 21

## After the Battle

**(Proverbs 21:1–31)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength. How greatly he exults in Your salvation!

<sup>2</sup> You have granted his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah

<sup>3</sup> For You welcomed him with rich blessings; You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.

<sup>4</sup> He asked You for life, and You granted it— length of days, forever and ever.

<sup>5</sup> Great is his glory in Your salvation; You bestow on him splendor and majesty.

<sup>6</sup> For You grant him blessings forever; You cheer him with joy in Your presence.

<sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in the LORD; through the loving devotion of the Most High, he will not be shaken.

<sup>8</sup> Your hand will apprehend all Your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate You.

<sup>9</sup> You will place them in a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. In His wrath the LORD will engulf them, and the fire will consume them.

<sup>10</sup> You will wipe their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from the sons of men.

<sup>11</sup> Though they intend You harm, the schemes they devise will not prevail.

<sup>12</sup> For You will put them to flight when Your bow is trained upon them.

<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.
