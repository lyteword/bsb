# Psalm 21

## After the Battle

**(Proverbs 21:1–31)**

For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

**¹** O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength. How greatly he exults in Your salvation!

**²** You have granted his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah

**³** For You welcomed him with rich blessings; You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.

**⁴** He asked You for life, and You granted it— length of days, forever and ever.

**⁵** Great is his glory in Your salvation; You bestow on him splendor and majesty.

**⁶** For You grant him blessings forever; You cheer him with joy in Your presence.

**⁷** For the king trusts in the LORD; through the loving devotion of the Most High, he will not be shaken.

**⁸** Your hand will apprehend all Your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate You.

**⁹** You will place them in a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. In His wrath the LORD will engulf them, and the fire will consume them.

**¹⁰** You will wipe their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from the sons of men.

**¹¹** Though they intend You harm, the schemes they devise will not prevail.

**¹²** For You will put them to flight when Your bow is trained upon them.

**¹³** Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.
