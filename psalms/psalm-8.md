# Psalm 8

## How Majestic Is Your Name!

For the choirmaster. According to Gittith.[^2154] A Psalm of David.

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> From the mouths of children and infants You have ordained praise [^2155] on account of Your adversaries, to silence the enemy and avenger.

<sup>3</sup> When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in place—

<sup>4</sup> what is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?

<sup>5</sup> You made him a little lower than the angels;[^2156] You crowned him with glory and honor.

<sup>6</sup> You made him ruler of the works of Your hands; You have placed everything under his feet:[^2157]

<sup>7</sup> all sheep and oxen, and even the beasts of the field,

<sup>8</sup> the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.

<sup>9</sup> O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
