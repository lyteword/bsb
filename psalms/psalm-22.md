# Psalm 22

## The Psalm of the Cross

**(Matthew 27:32–56; Mark 15:21–41; Luke 23:26–43; John 19:16–30)**

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.” A Psalm of David.

**¹** My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?[^2184] Why are You so far from saving me, so far from my words of groaning?

**²** I cry out by day, O my God, but You do not answer, and by night, but I have no rest.

**³** Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.

**⁴** In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.

**⁵** They cried out to You and were set free; they trusted in You and were not disappointed.

**⁶** But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.

**⁷** All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads:

**⁸** “He trusts in the LORD, let the LORD deliver him; let the LORD rescue him, since He delights in him.”[^2185]

**⁹** Yet You brought me forth from the womb; You made me secure at my mother’s breast.

**¹⁰** From birth I was cast upon You; from my mother’s womb You have been my God.

**¹¹** Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.

**¹²** Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.

**¹³** They open their jaws against me like lions that roar and maul.

**¹⁴** I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed. My heart is like wax; it melts away within me.

**¹⁵** My strength [^2186] is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me in the dust of death.

**¹⁶** For dogs surround me; a band of evil men encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet.[^2187]

**¹⁷** I can count all my bones; they stare and gloat over me.

**¹⁸** They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.[^2188]

**¹⁹** But You, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.

**²⁰** Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of wild dogs.

**²¹** Save me from the mouth of the lion; at the horns of the wild oxen You have answered me!

**²²** I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; I will praise You in the assembly.[^2189]

**²³** You who fear the LORD, praise Him! All descendants of Jacob, honor Him! All offspring of Israel, revere Him!

**²⁴** For He has not despised or detested the torment of the afflicted. He has not hidden His face from him, but has attended to his cry for help.

**²⁵** My praise for You resounds in the great assembly; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear You.

**²⁶** The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise Him. May your hearts live forever!

**²⁷** All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before Him.

**²⁸** For dominion belongs to the LORD and He rules over the nations.

**²⁹** All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him— even those unable to preserve their lives.

**³⁰** Posterity will serve Him; they will declare the Lord to a new generation.

**³¹** They will come and proclaim His righteousness to a people yet unborn— all that He has done.
