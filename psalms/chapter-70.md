# Chapter 70

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Hurry, O LORD, to help me! 

<sup>2</sup> May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated. 

<sup>3</sup> May those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame. 

<sup>4</sup> May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “Let God be magnified!” 

<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
