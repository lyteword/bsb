# Chapter 77

<sup>1</sup> For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me. 

<sup>2</sup> In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. 

<sup>4</sup> You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak. 

<sup>5</sup> I considered the days of old, the years long in the past. 

<sup>6</sup> At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered: 

<sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again? 

<sup>8</sup> Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time? 

<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” 

<sup>10</sup> So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.” 

<sup>11</sup> I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old. 

<sup>12</sup> I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds. 

<sup>13</sup> Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God? 

<sup>14</sup> You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. 

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken. 

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth. 

<sup>18</sup> Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked. 

<sup>19</sup> Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found. 

<sup>20</sup> You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
