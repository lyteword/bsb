# Psalm 112

## The Blessed Fear of the LORD

**(Psalms 128:1–6)**

<sup>1</sup> Hallelujah![^2380] Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.

<sup>2</sup> His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.

<sup>4</sup> Light dawns in the darkness for the upright— for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.

<sup>5</sup> It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.

<sup>6</sup> Surely he will never be shaken; the righteous man will be remembered forever.

<sup>7</sup> He does not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.

<sup>8</sup> His heart is assured; he does not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.

<sup>9</sup> He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever;[^2381] his horn will be lifted high in honor.

<sup>10</sup> The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
