# Chapter 97

<sup>1</sup> The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the distant shores be glad. 

<sup>2</sup> Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne’s foundation. 

<sup>3</sup> Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side. 

<sup>4</sup> His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles. 

<sup>5</sup> The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory. 

<sup>7</sup> All worshipers of images are put to shame— those who boast in idols. Worship Him, all you gods! 

<sup>8</sup> Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments, O LORD. 

<sup>9</sup> For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. 

<sup>10</sup> Hate evil, O you who love the LORD! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> Light shines on the righteous, gladness on the upright in heart. 

<sup>12</sup> Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.
