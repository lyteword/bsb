# Psalm 58

## God Judges the Earth

For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam [^2272] of David.

<sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak justly, O rulers? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?

<sup>2</sup> No, in your hearts you devise injustice; with your hands you mete out violence on the earth.

<sup>3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb; the liars go astray from birth.

<sup>4</sup> Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like a cobra that shuts its ears,

<sup>5</sup> refusing to hear the tune of the charmer who skillfully weaves his spell.

<sup>6</sup> O God, shatter their teeth in their mouths; O LORD, tear out the fangs of the lions.

<sup>7</sup> May they vanish like water that runs off; when they draw the bow, may their arrows be blunted.[^2273]

<sup>8</sup> Like a slug that dissolves in its slime, like a woman’s stillborn child, may they never see the sun.

<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the burning thorns— whether green or dry— He will sweep them away.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous will rejoice when they see they are avenged; they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.

<sup>11</sup> Then men will say, “There is surely a reward for the righteous! There is surely a God who judges the earth!”

[^2272]: 58:0 Miktam is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 16 and 56–60.
[^2273]: 58:7 Or when they are trodden down, may they wither like grass
