## The Song of Deborah and Barak

**(Exodus 15:1–21)**

<sup>1</sup> On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:

<sup>2</sup> “When the princes take the lead in Israel, when the people volunteer, bless the LORD.

<sup>3</sup> Listen, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.

<sup>4</sup> O LORD, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the land of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens poured out rain, and the clouds poured down water.

<sup>5</sup> The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.

<sup>6</sup> In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted and the travelers took the byways.

<sup>7</sup> Life in the villages ceased; it ended in Israel, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel.

<sup>8</sup> When they chose new gods, then war came to their gates. Not a shield or spear was found among forty thousand in Israel.

<sup>9</sup> My heart is with the princes of Israel, with the volunteers among the people. Bless the LORD!

<sup>10</sup> You who ride white donkeys, who sit on saddle blankets, and you who travel the road, ponder

<sup>11</sup> the voices of the singers [^885] at the watering places. There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous deeds of His villagers [^886] in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates:

<sup>12</sup> ‘Awake, awake, O Deborah! Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, O Barak, and take hold of your captives, O son of Abinoam!’

<sup>13</sup> Then the survivors came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came down to me against the mighty.

<sup>14</sup> Some came from Ephraim, with their roots in Amalek; Benjamin came with your people after you. The commanders came down from Machir, the bearers of the marshal’s staff from Zebulun.

<sup>15</sup> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar was with Barak, rushing into the valley at his heels. In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.[^887]

<sup>16</sup> Why did you sit among the sheepfolds to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.

<sup>17</sup> Gilead remained beyond the Jordan. Dan, why did you linger by the ships? Asher stayed at the coast and remained in his harbors.

<sup>18</sup> Zebulun was a people who risked their lives; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the battlefield.

<sup>19</sup> Kings came and fought; then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no plunder of silver.

<sup>20</sup> From the heavens the stars fought; from their courses they fought against Sisera.

<sup>21</sup> The River Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the River Kishon. March on, O my soul, in strength!

<sup>22</sup> Then the hooves of horses thundered— the mad galloping of his stallions.

<sup>23</sup> ‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the LORD. ‘Bitterly curse her inhabitants; for they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.’

<sup>24</sup> Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.

<sup>25</sup> He asked for water, and she gave him milk. In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.

<sup>26</sup> She reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera and crushed his skull; she shattered and pierced his temple.

<sup>27</sup> At her feet he collapsed, he fell, there he lay still; at her feet he collapsed, he fell; where he collapsed, there he fell dead.

<sup>28</sup> Sisera’s mother looked through the window; she peered through the lattice and lamented: ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? What has delayed the clatter of his chariots?’

<sup>29</sup> Her wisest ladies answer; indeed she keeps telling herself,

<sup>30</sup> ‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil— a girl or two for each warrior, a plunder of dyed garments for Sisera, the spoil of embroidered garments for the neck of the looter?’

<sup>31</sup> So may all Your enemies perish, O LORD! But may those who love You shine like the sun at its brightest.” And the land had rest for forty years.

[^885]: 5:11 Or archers or those who divide the sheep
[^886]: 5:11 Or warriors
[^887]: 5:15 Or much searching of heart; also in verse 16
