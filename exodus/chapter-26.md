# Chapter 26

## The Ten Curtains for the Tabernacle

**(Exodus 36:8–13)**

**¹** “You are to construct the tabernacle itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them.

**²** Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide [^358]—all curtains the same size.

**³** Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well.

**⁴** Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.

**⁵** Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another.

**⁶** Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.

## The Eleven Curtains of Goat Hair

**(Exodus 36:14–19)**

**⁷** You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.

**⁸** Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.[^359]

**⁹** Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent.

**¹⁰** Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.

**¹¹** Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit.

**¹²** As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.

**¹³** And the tent curtains will be a cubit [^360] longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.

**¹⁴** Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.[^361]

## The Frames and Bases

**(Exodus 36:20–34)**

**¹⁵** You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.

**¹⁶** Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.[^362]

**¹⁷** Two tenons [^363] must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.

**¹⁸** Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,

**¹⁹** with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.

**²⁰** For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames

**²¹** and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.

**²²** Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,

**²³** and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,

**²⁴** coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners.

**²⁵** So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.

**²⁶** You are also to make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,

**²⁷** five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.

**²⁸** The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other.

**²⁹** Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.

**³⁰** So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.

## The Veil

**(Exodus 36:35–36)**

**³¹** Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.

**³²** Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.

**³³** And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony [^364] behind the veil. So the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.[^365]

**³⁴** Put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.

**³⁵** And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side.

## The Curtain for the Entrance

**(Exodus 36:37–38)**

**³⁶** For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.

**³⁷** Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them.

[^358]: 26:2 Each of the ten curtains was approximately 42 feet long and 6 feet wide (12.8 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).
[^359]: 26:8 Each of the eleven curtains was approximately 45 feet long and 6 feet wide (13.7 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).
[^360]: 26:13 A cubit is approximately 18 inches or 45.7 centimeters.
[^361]: 26:14 Possibly the hides of large aquatic mammals
[^362]: 26:16 Each frame was approximately 15 feet long and 2.25 feet wide (4.6 meters long and 68.6 centimeters wide).
[^363]: 26:17 That is, projecting pieces of wood made for insertion into another piece; similarly in verse 19.
[^364]: 26:33 That is, the ark of the covenant; also in verse 34
[^365]: 26:33 Or the Holy of Holies; also in verse 34
