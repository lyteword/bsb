# Chapter 27

## The Bronze Altar

**(Exodus 38:1–7)**

**¹** “You are to build an altar of acacia wood. The altar must be square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.[^366]

**²** Make a horn on each of its four corners, so that the horns are of one piece, and overlay it with bronze.

**³** Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots for removing ashes, its shovels, its sprinkling bowls, its meat forks, and its firepans.

**⁴** Construct for it a grate of bronze mesh, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the mesh.

**⁵** Set the grate beneath the ledge of the altar, so that the mesh comes halfway up the altar.

**⁶** Additionally, make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze.

**⁷** The poles are to be inserted into the rings so that the poles are on two sides of the altar when it is carried.

**⁸** Construct the altar with boards so that it is hollow. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain.

## The Courtyard

**(Exodus 38:9–20)**

**⁹** You are also to make a courtyard for the tabernacle. On the south side of the courtyard make curtains of finely spun linen, a hundred cubits long [^367] on one side,

**¹⁰** with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts.

**¹¹** Likewise there are to be curtains on the north side, a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.

**¹²** The curtains on the west side of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide,[^368] with ten posts and ten bases.

**¹³** The east side of the courtyard, toward the sunrise, is to be fifty cubits wide.

**¹⁴** Make the curtains on one side fifteen cubits long,[^369] with three posts and three bases,

**¹⁵** and the curtains on the other side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.

**¹⁶** The gate of the courtyard shall be twenty cubits long,[^370] with a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It shall have four posts and four bases.

**¹⁷** All the posts around the courtyard shall have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases.

**¹⁸** The entire courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide,[^371] with curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high,[^372] and with bronze bases.

**¹⁹** All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made of bronze.

## The Oil for the Lamps

**(Leviticus 24:1–4)**

**²⁰** And you are to command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.

**²¹** In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony,[^373] Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come.
