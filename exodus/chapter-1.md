# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 

<sup>2</sup> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 

<sup>3</sup> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 

<sup>4</sup> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 

<sup>5</sup> The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt. 

<sup>6</sup> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 

<sup>7</sup> but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them. 

<sup>8</sup> Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 

<sup>9</sup> “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us. 

<sup>10</sup> Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.” 

<sup>11</sup> So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 

<sup>12</sup> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. 

<sup>13</sup> They worked the Israelites ruthlessly 

<sup>14</sup> and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh. 

<sup>15</sup> Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 

<sup>16</sup> “When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.” 

<sup>17</sup> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live. 

<sup>18</sup> So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” 

<sup>19</sup> The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.” 

<sup>20</sup> So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous. 

<sup>21</sup> And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. 

<sup>22</sup> Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”
