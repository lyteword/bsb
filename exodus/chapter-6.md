# Chapter 6

## God Promises Deliverance

**¹** But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”

**²** God also told Moses, “I am the LORD.

**³** I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty,[^256] but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them.

**⁴** I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.

**⁵** Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.

**⁶** Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.

**⁷** I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.

**⁸** And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’”

**⁹** Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him.

**¹⁰** So the LORD said to Moses,

**¹¹** “Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.”

**¹²** But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?[^257]”

**¹³** Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.

**²⁶** It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.”

**²⁷** Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.

**²⁸** Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,

**²⁹** He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.”

**³⁰** But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
