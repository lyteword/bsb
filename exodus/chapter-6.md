# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.” 

<sup>2</sup> God also told Moses, “I am the LORD. 

<sup>3</sup> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them. 

<sup>4</sup> I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners. 

<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. 

<sup>7</sup> I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. 

<sup>8</sup> And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’” 

<sup>9</sup> Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him. 

<sup>10</sup> So the LORD said to Moses, 

<sup>11</sup> “Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.” 

<sup>12</sup> But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?” 

<sup>13</sup> Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt. 

<sup>14</sup> These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben. 

<sup>15</sup> The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon. 

<sup>16</sup> These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 

<sup>17</sup> The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their clans. 

<sup>18</sup> The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 

<sup>19</sup> The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites according to their records. 

<sup>20</sup> And Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 

<sup>21</sup> The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 

<sup>22</sup> The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 

<sup>23</sup> And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 

<sup>24</sup> The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the clans of the Korahites. 

<sup>25</sup> Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families by their clans. 

<sup>26</sup> It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.” 

<sup>27</sup> Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. 

<sup>28</sup> Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, 

<sup>29</sup> He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.” 

<sup>30</sup> But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
