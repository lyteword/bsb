# Chapter 3

## Judgment on Nineveh

<sup>1</sup> Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without prey.

<sup>2</sup> The crack of the whip, the rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!

<sup>3</sup> Charging horseman, flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses, dead bodies without end— they stumble over their dead—

<sup>4</sup> because of the many harlotries of the harlot, the seductive mistress of sorcery, who betrays nations by her prostitution and clans by her witchcraft.

<sup>5</sup> “Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show your nakedness to the nations and your shame to the kingdoms.

<sup>6</sup> I will pelt you with filth and treat you with contempt; I will make a spectacle of you.

<sup>7</sup> Then all who see you will recoil from you and say, ‘Nineveh is devastated; who will grieve for her?’ Where can I find comforters for you?”

<sup>8</sup> Are you better than Thebes,[^3435] stationed by the Nile with water around her, whose rampart was the sea, whose wall was the water?

<sup>9</sup> Cush [^3436] and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were her allies.

<sup>10</sup> Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity. Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her nobles were bound in chains.

<sup>11</sup> You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.

<sup>12</sup> All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs; when shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!

<sup>13</sup> Look at your troops— they are like your women! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire consumes their bars.

<sup>14</sup> Draw your water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses. Work the clay and tread the mortar; repair the brick kiln!

<sup>15</sup> There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down and consume you like a young locust. Make yourself many like the young locust; make yourself many like the swarming locust!

<sup>16</sup> You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the sky. The young locust strips the land and flies away.

<sup>17</sup> Your guards [^3437] are like the swarming locust, and your scribes [^3438] like clouds of locusts that settle on the walls on a cold day. When the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where.

<sup>18</sup> O king of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your officers sleep. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.

<sup>19</sup> There is no healing for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news of you applaud your downfall, for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?
