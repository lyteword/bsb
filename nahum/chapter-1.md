## The Burden against Nineveh

**(Jonah 1:1–3)**

<sup>1</sup> This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:

<sup>2</sup> The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on His foes and reserves wrath for His enemies.

<sup>3</sup> The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.

<sup>4</sup> He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.

<sup>5</sup> The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles at His presence— the world and all its dwellers.

<sup>6</sup> Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before Him.

<sup>7</sup> The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; He cares for those who trust in Him.

<sup>8</sup> But with an overwhelming flood He will make an end of Nineveh [^3432] and pursue His enemies into darkness.

<sup>9</sup> Whatever you plot against the LORD, He will bring to an end. Affliction will not rise up a second time.

<sup>10</sup> For they will be entangled as with thorns and consumed like the drink of a drunkard— like stubble that is fully dry.

<sup>11</sup> From you, O Nineveh, comes forth a plotter of evil against the LORD, a counselor of wickedness.

<sup>12</sup> This is what the LORD says: “Though they are allied and numerous, yet they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, O Judah, I will afflict you no longer.

<sup>13</sup> For I will now break their yoke from your neck and tear away your shackles.”

<sup>14</sup> The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh: “There will be no descendants to carry on your name. I will cut off the carved image and cast idol from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.”

<sup>15</sup> Look to the mountains— the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked will never again march through you; they will be utterly cut off.
