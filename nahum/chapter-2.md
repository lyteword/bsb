## The Overthrow of Nineveh

<sup>1</sup> One who scatters advances against you, O Nineveh. Guard the fortress! Watch the road! Brace yourselves![^3433] Summon all your strength!

<sup>2</sup> For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and ruined the branches of their vine.

<sup>3</sup> The shields of his mighty men are red; the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariots flash like fire on the day they are prepared, and the spears of cypress have been brandished.[^3434]

<sup>4</sup> The chariots dash through the streets; they rush around the plazas, appearing like torches, darting about like lightning.

<sup>5</sup> He summons his nobles; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.

<sup>6</sup> The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.

<sup>7</sup> It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away; her maidservants moan like doves, and beat upon their breasts.

<sup>8</sup> Nineveh has been like a pool of water throughout her days, but now it is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.

<sup>9</sup> “Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.

<sup>10</sup> She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and laid waste! Hearts melt, knees knock, bodies tremble, and every face grows pale!

<sup>11</sup> Where is the lions’ lair or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs, with nothing to frighten them away?

<sup>12</sup> The lion mauled enough for its cubs and strangled prey for the lioness. It filled its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey.

<sup>13</sup> “Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will reduce your chariots to cinders, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”

[^3433]: 2:1 Hebrew Strengthen your loins!
[^3434]: 2:3 Hebrew; alternately, the spears may be of pine or juniper or fir; LXX and Syriac they are prepared, and the horsemen rush to and fro.
