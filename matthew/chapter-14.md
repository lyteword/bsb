# Chapter 14

## The Beheading of John

**(Mark 6:14–29; Luke 9:7–9)**

**¹** At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus

**²** and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”

**³** Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,

**⁴** because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”

**⁵** Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.

**⁶** On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod

**⁷** so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.

**⁸** Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”

**⁹** The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted

**¹⁰** and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.

**¹¹** John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.

**¹²** Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.

## The Feeding of the Five Thousand

**(Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–15)**

**¹³** When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns.

**¹⁴** When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.

**¹⁵** When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”

**¹⁶** “They do not need to go away,” Jesus replied. “You give them something to eat.”

**¹⁷** “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.

**¹⁸** “Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.

**¹⁹** And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.

**²⁰** They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

**²¹** About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.

## Jesus Walks on Water

**(Mark 6:45–52; John 6:16–21)**

**²²** Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.

**²³** After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,

**²⁴** but the boat was already far [^3631] from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.

**²⁵** During the fourth watch of the night,[^3632] Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.

**²⁶** When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.

**²⁷** But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”

**²⁸** “Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”

**²⁹** “Come,” said Jesus. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

**³⁰** But when he saw the strength of the wind,[^3633] he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

**³¹** Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?”

**³²** And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down.

**³³** Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”

## Jesus Heals at Gennesaret

**(Mark 6:53–56)**

**³⁴** When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.

**³⁵** And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him

**³⁶** and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.

[^3631]: 14:24 Greek many stadia; a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters
[^3632]: 14:25 That is, between three and six in the morning
[^3633]: 14:30 Literally when he saw the strong wind; NE and WH do not include strong.
