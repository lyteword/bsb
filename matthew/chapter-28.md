# Chapter 28

## The Resurrection

**(Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–12; John 20:1–9)**

**¹** After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,[^3732] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.

**²** Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.

**³** His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

**⁴** The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.

**⁵** But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

**⁶** He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.[^3733]

**⁷** Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”

**⁸** So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.

**⁹** Suddenly [^3734] Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.

**¹⁰** “Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”

## The Report of the Guards

**¹¹** While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.

**¹²** And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money

**¹³** and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’

**¹⁴** If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”

**¹⁵** So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.

## The Great Commission

**(Mark 16:14–18)**

**¹⁶** Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.

**¹⁷** When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.

**¹⁸** Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.

**¹⁹** Therefore go and make disciples [^3735] of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

**²⁰** and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
