# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 

<sup>2</sup> Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. 

<sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 

<sup>4</sup> The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men. 

<sup>5</sup> But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 

<sup>6</sup> He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay. 

<sup>7</sup> Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.” 

<sup>8</sup> So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. 

<sup>9</sup> Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. 

<sup>10</sup> “Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.” 

<sup>11</sup> While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 

<sup>12</sup> And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money 

<sup>13</sup> and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ 

<sup>14</sup> If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 

<sup>15</sup> So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day. 

<sup>16</sup> Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated. 

<sup>17</sup> When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted. 

<sup>18</sup> Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. 

<sup>19</sup> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, 

<sup>20</sup> and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
