# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 

<sup>2</sup> Jesus invited a little child to stand among them. 

<sup>3</sup> “Truly I tell you,” He said, “unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

<sup>4</sup> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 

<sup>5</sup> And whoever welcomes a little child like this in My name welcomes Me. 

<sup>6</sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 

<sup>7</sup> Woe to the world for the causes of sin. These stumbling blocks must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! 

<sup>8</sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. 

<sup>9</sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. 

<sup>10</sup> See that you do not look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven.
