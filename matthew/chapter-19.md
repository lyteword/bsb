# Chapter 19

## Teachings about Divorce

**(Mark 10:1–12)**

**¹** When Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.

**²** Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

**³** Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”

**⁴** Jesus answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’[^3655]

**⁵** and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’[^3656]?

**⁶** So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”

**⁷** “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?[^3657]”

**⁸** Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart. But it was not this way from the beginning.

**⁹** Now I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.[^3658]”

**¹⁰** His disciples said to Him, “If this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.”

**¹¹** “Not everyone can accept this word,” He replied, “but only those to whom it has been given.

**¹²** For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

## Jesus Blesses the Children

**(Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17)**

**¹³** Then little children were brought to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them.

**¹⁴** But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

**¹⁵** And after He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there.

## The Rich Young Man

**(Mark 10:17–31; Luke 18:18–30)**

**¹⁶** Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”

**¹⁷** “Why do you ask Me about what is good?”[^3659] Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”

**¹⁸** “Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus answered, “‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,

**¹⁹** honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.’[^3660]”

**²⁰** “All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?”

**²¹** Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”

**²²** When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.

**²³** Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

**²⁴** Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

**²⁵** When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”

**²⁶** Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

**²⁷** “Look,” Peter replied, “we have left everything to follow You. What then will there be for us?”

**²⁸** Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, in the renewal of all things,[^3661] when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

**²⁹** And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife [^3662] or children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

**³⁰** But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
