# Chapter 19

## Teachings about Divorce

**(Mark 10:1–12)**

<sup>1</sup> When Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.

<sup>2</sup> Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

<sup>3</sup> Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”

<sup>4</sup> Jesus answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’[^3655]

<sup>5</sup> and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’[^3656]?

<sup>6</sup> So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”

<sup>7</sup> “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?[^3657]”

<sup>8</sup> Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart. But it was not this way from the beginning.

<sup>9</sup> Now I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.[^3658]”

<sup>10</sup> His disciples said to Him, “If this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.”

<sup>11</sup> “Not everyone can accept this word,” He replied, “but only those to whom it has been given.

<sup>12</sup> For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

## Jesus Blesses the Children

**(Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17)**

<sup>13</sup> Then little children were brought to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them.

<sup>14</sup> But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

<sup>15</sup> And after He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there.

## The Rich Young Man

**(Mark 10:17–31; Luke 18:18–30)**

<sup>16</sup> Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”

<sup>17</sup> “Why do you ask Me about what is good?”[^3659] Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”

<sup>18</sup> “Which ones?” the man asked. Jesus answered, “‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,

<sup>19</sup> honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.’[^3660]”

<sup>20</sup> “All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?”

<sup>21</sup> Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”

<sup>22</sup> When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.

<sup>23</sup> Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

<sup>24</sup> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

<sup>25</sup> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”

<sup>26</sup> Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

<sup>27</sup> “Look,” Peter replied, “we have left everything to follow You. What then will there be for us?”

<sup>28</sup> Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, in the renewal of all things,[^3661] when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

<sup>29</sup> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife [^3662] or children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

<sup>30</sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
