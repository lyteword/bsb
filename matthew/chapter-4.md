# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 

<sup>2</sup> After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. 

<sup>3</sup> The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” 

<sup>4</sup> But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” 

<sup>5</sup> Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. 

<sup>6</sup> “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You, and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’” 

<sup>7</sup> Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” 

<sup>8</sup> Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 

<sup>9</sup> “All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.” 

<sup>10</sup> “Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus declared. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’” 

<sup>11</sup> Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him. 

<sup>12</sup> When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee. 

<sup>13</sup> Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 

<sup>14</sup> to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 

<sup>15</sup> “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— 

<sup>16</sup> the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.” 

<sup>17</sup> From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” 

<sup>18</sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 

<sup>19</sup> “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 

<sup>20</sup> And at once they left their nets and followed Him. 

<sup>21</sup> Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them, 

<sup>22</sup> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him. 

<sup>23</sup> Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 

<sup>24</sup> News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and He healed them. 

<sup>25</sup> The large crowds that followed Him came from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
