# Chapter 4

## The Temptation of Jesus

**(Mark 1:12–13; Luke 4:1–13)**

**¹** Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

**²** After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.

**³** The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”

**⁴** But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’[^3559]”

**⁵** Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.

**⁶** “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You, and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’[^3560]”

**⁷** Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’[^3561]”

**⁸** Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

**⁹** “All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.”

**¹⁰** “Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus told him. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’[^3562]”

**¹¹** Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.

## Jesus Begins His Ministry

**(Isaiah 9:1–7; Mark 1:14–15; Luke 4:14–15)**

**¹²** When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee.

**¹³** Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,

**¹⁴** to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:

**¹⁵** “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—

**¹⁶** the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.”[^3563]

**¹⁷** From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”

## The First Disciples

**(Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11; John 1:35–42)**

**¹⁸** As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

**¹⁹** “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”

**²⁰** And at once they left their nets and followed Him.

**²¹** Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them,

**²²** and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.

## Jesus Heals the Multitudes

**(Mark 3:7–12; Luke 6:17–19)**

**²³** Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.

**²⁴** News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.

**²⁵** Large crowds followed Him, having come from Galilee, the Decapolis,[^3564] Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
