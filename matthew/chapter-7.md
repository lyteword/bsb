# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> “Do not judge, or you will be judged. 

<sup>2</sup> For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 

<sup>3</sup> Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye? 

<sup>4</sup> How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye? 

<sup>5</sup> You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. 

<sup>6</sup> Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces. 

<sup>7</sup> Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. 

<sup>8</sup> For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. 

<sup>9</sup> Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 

<sup>10</sup> Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 

<sup>11</sup> So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 

<sup>12</sup> In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets. 

<sup>13</sup> Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 

<sup>14</sup> But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. 

<sup>15</sup> Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 

<sup>16</sup> By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 

<sup>17</sup> Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 

<sup>18</sup> A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 

<sup>19</sup> Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 

<sup>20</sup> So then, by their fruit you will recognize them. 

<sup>21</sup> Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 

<sup>22</sup> Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ 

<sup>23</sup> Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’ 

<sup>24</sup> Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 

<sup>25</sup> The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock. 

<sup>26</sup> But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 

<sup>27</sup> The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!” 

<sup>28</sup> When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching, 

<sup>29</sup> because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
