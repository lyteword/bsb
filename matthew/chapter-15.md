# Chapter 15

## The Tradition of the Elders

**(Mark 7:1–13)**

**¹** Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,

**²** “Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”

**³** Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?

**⁴** For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’[^3634] and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’[^3635]

**⁵** But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’

**⁶** he need not honor his father or mother with it.[^3636] Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

**⁷** You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:

**⁸** ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.

**⁹** They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’[^3637]”

## What Defiles a Man

**(Mark 7:14–23)**

**¹⁰** Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand.

**¹¹** A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”

**¹²** Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”

**¹³** But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.

**¹⁴** Disregard them! They are blind guides.[^3638] If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”

**¹⁵** Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”

**¹⁶** “Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked.

**¹⁷** “Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?

**¹⁸** But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.

**¹⁹** For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.

**²⁰** These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”

## The Faith of the Canaanite Woman

**(Mark 7:24–30)**

**²¹** Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.

**²²** And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”

**²³** But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”

**²⁴** He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

**²⁵** The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.

**²⁶** But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”

**²⁷** “Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs [^3639] eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”

**²⁸** “O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

## The Feeding of the Four Thousand

**(2 Kings 4:42–44; Mark 8:1–10)**

**²⁹** Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down.

**³⁰** Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.

**³¹** The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

**³²** Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”

**³³** The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”

**³⁴** “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”

**³⁵** And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.

**³⁶** Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.

**³⁷** They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

**³⁸** A total of four thousand men were fed, besides women and children.

**³⁹** After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
