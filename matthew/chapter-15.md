# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 

<sup>2</sup> “Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.” 

<sup>3</sup> Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? 

<sup>4</sup> For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ 

<sup>5</sup> But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’ 

<sup>6</sup> he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 

<sup>7</sup> You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you: 

<sup>8</sup> ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. 

<sup>9</sup> They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’” 

<sup>10</sup> Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand. 

<sup>11</sup> A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.” 

<sup>12</sup> Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?” 

<sup>13</sup> But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots. 

<sup>14</sup> Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” 

<sup>15</sup> Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.” 

<sup>16</sup> “Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked. 

<sup>17</sup> “Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated? 

<sup>18</sup> But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man. 

<sup>19</sup> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander. 

<sup>20</sup> These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.” 

<sup>21</sup> Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. 

<sup>22</sup> And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.” 

<sup>23</sup> But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.” 

<sup>24</sup> He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 

<sup>25</sup> The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said. 

<sup>26</sup> But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” 

<sup>27</sup> “Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” 

<sup>28</sup> “O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. 

<sup>29</sup> Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down. 

<sup>30</sup> Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them. 

<sup>31</sup> The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.” 

<sup>33</sup> The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?” 

<sup>34</sup> “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.” 

<sup>35</sup> And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. 

<sup>36</sup> Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 

<sup>37</sup> They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 

<sup>38</sup> A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children. 

<sup>39</sup> After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
