## The Genealogy of Jesus

**(Ruth 4:18–22; Luke 3:23–38)**

<sup>1</sup> This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:

<sup>2</sup> Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.

<sup>3</sup> Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.[^3543]

<sup>4</sup> Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.

<sup>5</sup> Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,

<sup>6</sup> and Jesse the father of David the king. Next: David was the father of Solomon by Uriah’s wife,

<sup>7</sup> Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.[^3544]

<sup>8</sup> Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.

<sup>9</sup> Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.

<sup>10</sup> Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon,[^3545] Amon the father of Josiah,

<sup>11</sup> and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

<sup>12</sup> After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,

<sup>13</sup> Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.

<sup>14</sup> Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.

<sup>15</sup> Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,

<sup>16</sup> and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

<sup>17</sup> In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.

## The Birth of Jesus

**(Isaiah 7:10–16; Luke 2:1–7)**

<sup>18</sup> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.

<sup>19</sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.

<sup>20</sup> But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

<sup>21</sup> She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus,[^3546] because He will save His people from their sins.”

<sup>22</sup> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:

<sup>23</sup> “Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call Him Immanuel”[^3547] (which means, “God with us”[^3548]).

<sup>24</sup> When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife.

<sup>25</sup> But he had no union with her [^3549] until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.
