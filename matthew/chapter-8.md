# Chapter 8

## The Leper’s Prayer

**(Leviticus 14:1–32; Mark 1:40–45; Luke 5:12–16)**

**¹** When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.

**²** Suddenly a leper [^3591] came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”

**³** Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

**⁴** Then Jesus instructed him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.”[^3592]

## The Faith of the Centurion

**(Luke 7:1–10; John 4:43–54)**

**⁵** When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him,

**⁶** “Lord, my servant [^3593] lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.”

**⁷** “I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied.

**⁸** The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

**⁹** For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”

**¹⁰** When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.

**¹¹** I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

**¹²** But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

**¹³** Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that very hour.

## Jesus Heals at Peter’s House

**(Mark 1:29–34; Luke 4:38–41)**

**¹⁴** When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever.

**¹⁵** So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.

**¹⁶** When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.

**¹⁷** This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.”[^3594]

## The Cost of Discipleship

**(Luke 9:57–62; Luke 14:25–33; John 6:59–66)**

**¹⁸** When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea.[^3595]

**¹⁹** And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”

**²⁰** Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”

**²¹** Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”

**²²** But Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

## Jesus Calms the Storm

**(Psalms 107:1–43; Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25)**

**²³** When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.

**²⁴** Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves. But Jesus was sleeping.

**²⁵** The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”

**²⁶** “You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm.

**²⁷** The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!”

## The Demons and the Pigs

**(Mark 5:1–20; Luke 8:26–39)**

**²⁸** When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,[^3596] He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.

**²⁹** “What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?”

**³⁰** In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding.

**³¹** So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”

**³²** “Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.

**³³** Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon-possessed men.

**³⁴** Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
