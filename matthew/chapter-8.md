# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. 

<sup>2</sup> Suddenly a leper came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” 

<sup>3</sup> Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 

<sup>4</sup> Then Jesus instructed him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.” 

<sup>5</sup> When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him, 

<sup>6</sup> “Lord, my servant lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.” 

<sup>7</sup> “I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied. 

<sup>8</sup> The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 

<sup>9</sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.” 

<sup>10</sup> When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. 

<sup>11</sup> I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 

<sup>13</sup> Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that very hour. 

<sup>14</sup> When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever. 

<sup>15</sup> So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve them. 

<sup>16</sup> When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. 

<sup>17</sup> This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took on our infirmities and carried our diseases.” 

<sup>18</sup> When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea. 

<sup>19</sup> And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.” 

<sup>20</sup> Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.” 

<sup>21</sup> Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” 

<sup>22</sup> But Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” 

<sup>23</sup> When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him. 

<sup>24</sup> Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves; but Jesus was sleeping. 

<sup>25</sup> The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 

<sup>26</sup> “You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm. 

<sup>27</sup> The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!” 

<sup>28</sup> When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. 

<sup>29</sup> “What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?” 

<sup>30</sup> In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding. 

<sup>31</sup> So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 

<sup>32</sup> “Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters. 

<sup>33</sup> Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon-possessed men. 

<sup>34</sup> Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
