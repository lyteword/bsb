# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples: 

<sup>2</sup> “The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. 

<sup>3</sup> So practice and observe everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. 

<sup>4</sup> They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. 

<sup>5</sup> All their deeds are done for men to see. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels. 

<sup>6</sup> They love the places of honor at banquets, the chief seats in the synagogues, 

<sup>7</sup> the greetings in the marketplaces, and the title of ‘Rabbi’ by which they are addressed. 

<sup>8</sup> But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. 

<sup>9</sup> And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 

<sup>10</sup> Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> The greatest among you shall be your servant. 

<sup>12</sup> For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. 

<sup>13</sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let in those who wish to enter.
