# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness. 

<sup>2</sup> These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 

<sup>3</sup> Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 

<sup>4</sup> Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. 

<sup>5</sup> These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 

<sup>6</sup> Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’ 

<sup>8</sup> Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give. 

<sup>9</sup> Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts. 

<sup>10</sup> Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions. 

<sup>11</sup> Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on. 

<sup>12</sup> As you enter the home, greet its occupants. 

<sup>13</sup> If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your peace return to you. 

<sup>14</sup> And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 

<sup>15</sup> Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. 

<sup>16</sup> Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves. 

<sup>17</sup> But beware of men; for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues. 

<sup>18</sup> On My account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles. 

<sup>19</sup> But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say. 

<sup>20</sup> For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. 

<sup>21</sup> Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. 

<sup>22</sup> You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. 

<sup>23</sup> When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 

<sup>24</sup> A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 

<sup>25</sup> It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 

<sup>26</sup> So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. 

<sup>27</sup> What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops. 

<sup>28</sup> Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 

<sup>29</sup> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. 

<sup>30</sup> And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 

<sup>31</sup> So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 

<sup>32</sup> Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven. 

<sup>33</sup> But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven. 

<sup>34</sup> Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 

<sup>35</sup> For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 

<sup>36</sup> A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’ 

<sup>37</sup> Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me; 

<sup>38</sup> and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me. 

<sup>39</sup> Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 

<sup>40</sup> He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 

<sup>41</sup> Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. 

<sup>42</sup> And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”
