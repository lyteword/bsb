# Chapter 10

## The Twelve Apostles

**(Mark 3:13–19; Luke 6:12–16)**

**¹** And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness.

**²** These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;

**³** Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

**⁴** Simon the Zealot,[^3602] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.[^3603]

## The Ministry of the Twelve

**(Mark 6:7–13; Luke 9:1–6)**

**⁵** These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.

**⁶** Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.

**⁷** As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’

**⁸** Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers,[^3604] drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.

**⁹** Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts.

**¹⁰** Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.

**¹¹** Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house [^3605] until you move on.

**¹²** As you enter the home, greet its occupants.[^3606]

**¹³** If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it, but if it is not, let your peace return to you.

**¹⁴** And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.

**¹⁵** Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

## Sheep among Wolves

**(2 Timothy 1:3–12)**

**¹⁶** Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.

**¹⁷** But beware of men, for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.

**¹⁸** On My account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.

**¹⁹** But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.

**²⁰** For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

**²¹** Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.

**²²** You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.

**²³** When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

**²⁴** A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.

**²⁵** It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul,[^3607] how much more the members of his household!

## Fear God Alone

**(Luke 12:4–7)**

**²⁶** So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.

**²⁷** What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.

**²⁸** Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.[^3608]

**²⁹** Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?[^3609] Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.

**³⁰** And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

**³¹** So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.

## Confessing Christ

**(Luke 12:8–12)**

**³²** Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.

**³³** But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.

## Not Peace but a Sword

**(Micah 7:1–6; Luke 12:49–53)**

**³⁴** Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.

**³⁵** For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

**³⁶** A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’[^3610]

**³⁷** Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;

**³⁸** and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.

**³⁹** Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.

## The Reward of Service

**(2 Kings 4:8–17)**

**⁴⁰** He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.

**⁴¹** Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.

**⁴²** And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”
