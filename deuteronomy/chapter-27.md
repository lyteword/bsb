# Chapter 27

## The Altar on Mount Ebal

**(Joshua 8:30–35)**

<sup>1</sup> Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all the commandments I am giving you today.

<sup>2</sup> And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster.

<sup>3</sup> Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.

<sup>4</sup> And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster.

<sup>5</sup> Moreover, you are to build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them.

<sup>6</sup> You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God.

<sup>7</sup> There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.

<sup>8</sup> And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.”

<sup>9</sup> Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the LORD your God.

<sup>10</sup> You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.”

## Curses Pronounced from Ebal

<sup>11</sup> On that day Moses commanded the people:

<sup>12</sup> “When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.

<sup>13</sup> And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

<sup>14</sup> Then the Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite:

<sup>15</sup> ‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved idol or molten image—an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of a craftsman—and sets it up in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>16</sup> ‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>17</sup> ‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>18</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lets a blind man wander in the road.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>19</sup> ‘Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>20</sup> ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he has violated his father’s marriage bed.’[^732] And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>21</sup> ‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>22</sup> ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>23</sup> ‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>24</sup> ‘Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>25</sup> ‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’

<sup>26</sup> ‘Cursed is he who does not put the words of this law into practice.’[^733] And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
