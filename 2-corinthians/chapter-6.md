# Chapter 6

## Paul’s Hardships and God’s Grace

**¹** As God’s fellow workers,[^4459] then, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.

**²** For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.”[^4460] Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation!

**³** We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry.

**⁴** Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities;

**⁵** in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger;

**⁶** in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;

**⁷** in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;

**⁸** through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine;

**⁹** unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed;

**¹⁰** sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.

**¹¹** We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide.

**¹²** It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained.

**¹³** As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.

## Do Not Be Unequally Yoked

**¹⁴** Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?

**¹⁵** What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?[^4461] Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?

**¹⁶** What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”[^4462]

**¹⁷** “Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”[^4463]

**¹⁸** And: “I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”[^4464]
