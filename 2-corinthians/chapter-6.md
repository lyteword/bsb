# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> As God’s fellow workers, then, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation! 

<sup>3</sup> We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry. 

<sup>4</sup> Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities; 

<sup>5</sup> in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger; 

<sup>6</sup> in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; 

<sup>7</sup> in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 

<sup>8</sup> through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine; 

<sup>9</sup> as unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed; 

<sup>10</sup> sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. 

<sup>11</sup> We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide. 

<sup>12</sup> It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained. 

<sup>13</sup> As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide your hearts also. 

<sup>14</sup> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 

<sup>15</sup> What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 

<sup>16</sup> What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.” 

<sup>17</sup> “Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.” 

<sup>18</sup> And: “I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”
