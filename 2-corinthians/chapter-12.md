# Chapter 12

## Paul’s Revelation

<sup>1</sup> I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to gain, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows.

<sup>3</sup> And I know that this man—whether in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows—

<sup>4</sup> was caught up to Paradise. The things he heard were inexpressible, things that man is not permitted to tell.

## Paul’s Thorn and God’s Grace

<sup>5</sup> I will boast about such a man, but I will not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses.

<sup>6</sup> Even if I wanted to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me,

<sup>7</sup> or because of these surpassingly great revelations. So to keep me from becoming conceited,[^4473] I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.

<sup>8</sup> Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.

<sup>9</sup> But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me.

<sup>10</sup> That is why, for the sake of Christ, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

## Paul’s Concern for the Corinthians

<sup>11</sup> I have become a fool, but you drove me to it. In fact, you should have commended me, since I am in no way inferior to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.

<sup>12</sup> The marks of a true apostle—signs, wonders, and miracles—were performed among you with great perseverance.

<sup>13</sup> In what way were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!

<sup>14</sup> See, I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden, because I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.

<sup>15</sup> And for the sake of your souls, I will most gladly spend my money and myself. If I love you more, will you love me less?

<sup>16</sup> Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you; but crafty as I am, I caught you by trickery.

<sup>17</sup> Did I exploit you by anyone I sent you?

<sup>18</sup> I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in any way? Did we not walk in the same Spirit and follow in the same footsteps?[^4474]

<sup>19</sup> Have you been thinking all along that we were making a defense to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all of this, beloved, is to build you up.

<sup>20</sup> For I am afraid that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and you may not find me as you wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, rage, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.

<sup>21</sup> I am afraid that when I come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of their acts of impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery.

[^4473]: 12:7 Some translators end the previous paragraph after verse 6, and begin verse 7 with So to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations,
[^4474]: 12:18 Literally Did we not walk in the same Spirit? Not in the same footsteps?
