# Chapter 6

## Serving with Honor

**(Ephesians 6:5–9; Colossians 3:22–25)**

**¹** All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor, so that God’s name and our teaching will not be discredited.

**²** Those who have believing masters should not show disrespect because they are brothers, but should serve them all the more, since those receiving their good service are beloved believers. Teach and encourage these principles.

## Reject False Doctrines

**³** If anyone teaches another doctrine and disagrees with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and with godly teaching,

**⁴** he is conceited and understands nothing. Instead, he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and disputes about words, out of which come envy, strife, abusive talk, evil suspicions,

**⁵** and constant friction between men of depraved mind who are devoid of the truth. These men regard godliness as a means of gain.[^4570]

## Godliness with Contentment

**⁶** Of course, godliness with contentment is great gain.

**⁷** For we brought nothing into the world, so [^4571] we cannot carry anything out of it.

**⁸** But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.

**⁹** Those who want to be rich, however, fall into temptation and become ensnared by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction.

**¹⁰** For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

## Fight the Good Fight

**¹¹** But you, O man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

**¹²** Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession before many witnesses.

**¹³** I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession in His testimony before Pontius Pilate:

**¹⁴** Keep this commandment without stain or reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,

**¹⁵** which the blessed and only Sovereign One—the King of kings and Lord of lords—will bring about in His own time.

**¹⁶** He alone is immortal and dwells in unapproachable light. No one has ever seen Him, nor can anyone see Him. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.

## A Charge to the Rich

**(Proverbs 23:1–5; James 5:1–6)**

**¹⁷** Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be conceited and not to put their hope in the uncertainty of wealth, but in God, who richly provides all things for us to enjoy.

**¹⁸** Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, and to be generous and ready to share,

**¹⁹** treasuring up for themselves a firm foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.

## Guard the Faith

**²⁰** O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid irreverent, empty chatter and the opposing arguments of so-called “knowledge,”

**²¹** which some have professed and thus swerved away from the faith. Grace be with you all.[^4572]

[^4570]: 6:5 BYZ and TR include Withdraw yourself from such.
[^4571]: 6:7 BYZ and TR so certainly
[^4572]: 6:21 BYZ and TR include Amen.
