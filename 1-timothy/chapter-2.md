# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone— 

<sup>2</sup> for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity. 

<sup>3</sup> This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 

<sup>4</sup> who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>5</sup> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time. 

<sup>7</sup> For this reason I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything. 

<sup>8</sup> Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension. 

<sup>9</sup> Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 

<sup>10</sup> but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God. 

<sup>11</sup> A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness. 

<sup>12</sup> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet. 

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was formed first, and then Eve. 

<sup>14</sup> And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression. 

<sup>15</sup> Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
