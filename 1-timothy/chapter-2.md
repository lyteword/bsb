# Chapter 2

## A Call to Prayer

<sup>1</sup> First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—

<sup>2</sup> for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity.

<sup>3</sup> This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,

<sup>4</sup> who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

<sup>5</sup> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

<sup>6</sup> who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.

<sup>7</sup> For this reason I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.

<sup>8</sup> Therefore I want the men everywhere [^4559] to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.

## Instructions to Women

<sup>9</sup> Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,

<sup>10</sup> but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.

<sup>11</sup> A woman [^4560] must learn in quietness and full submissiveness.

<sup>12</sup> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;[^4561] she is to remain quiet.

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

<sup>14</sup> And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.

<sup>15</sup> Women, however, will be saved[^4562] through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.

[^4559]: 2:8 Or in every place (of worship)
[^4560]: 2:11 Or wife; also in verse 12
[^4561]: 2:12 Or over her husband
[^4562]: 2:15 Literally She, however, will be saved
