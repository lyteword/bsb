# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task. 

<sup>2</sup> An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 

<sup>3</sup> not dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the love of money. 

<sup>4</sup> An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity. 

<sup>5</sup> For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God? 

<sup>6</sup> He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil. 

<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil. 

<sup>8</sup> Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued or given to much wine or greedy for money. 

<sup>9</sup> They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 

<sup>10</sup> Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons. 

<sup>11</sup> In the same way, the women must be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things. 

<sup>12</sup> A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household. 

<sup>13</sup> For those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>14</sup> Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these things 

<sup>15</sup> in case I am delayed, so that you will know how each one must conduct himself in Godâ€™s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. 

<sup>16</sup> By common confession, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, was taken up in glory.
