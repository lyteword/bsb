# Chapter 4

## A Warning against Apostasy

**¹** Now the Spirit expressly states that in later times some will abandon the faith to follow deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons,

**²** influenced by the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences are seared with a hot iron.

**³** They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from certain foods that God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

**⁴** For every creation of God is good, and nothing that is received with thanksgiving should be rejected,

**⁵** because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

## A Good Servant of Jesus Christ

**⁶** By pointing out these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of faith and sound instruction that you have followed.

**⁷** But reject irreverent, silly myths. Instead, train yourself for godliness.

**⁸** For physical exercise is of limited value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the one to come.

**⁹** This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance.

**¹⁰** To this end we labor and strive,[^4567] because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, and especially of those who believe.

**¹¹** Command and teach these things.

**¹²** Let no one despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.

**¹³** Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching.

**¹⁴** Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given you through the prophecy spoken over you at the laying on of the hands of the elders.

**¹⁵** Be diligent in these matters and absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.

**¹⁶** Pay close attention to your life and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
