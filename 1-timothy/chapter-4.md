# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Now the Spirit expressly states that in later times some will abandon the faith to follow deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons, 

<sup>2</sup> influenced by the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences are seared with a hot iron. 

<sup>3</sup> They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from certain foods that God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 

<sup>4</sup> For every creation of God is good, and nothing that is received with thanksgiving should be rejected, 

<sup>5</sup> because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 

<sup>6</sup> By pointing out these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of faith and sound instruction that you have followed. 

<sup>7</sup> But reject irreverent, silly myths. Instead, train yourself for godliness. 

<sup>8</sup> For physical exercise is of limited value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the one to come. 

<sup>9</sup> This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance. 

<sup>10</sup> To this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, and especially of those who believe. 

<sup>11</sup> Command and teach these things. 

<sup>12</sup> Let no one despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 

<sup>13</sup> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. 

<sup>14</sup> Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given you through the prophecy spoken over you at the laying on of the hands of the elders. 

<sup>15</sup> Be diligent in these matters and absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all. 

<sup>16</sup> Pay close attention to your life and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
