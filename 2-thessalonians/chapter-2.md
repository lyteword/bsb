# Chapter 2

## The Man of Lawlessness

**¹** Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to Him, we ask you, brothers,

**²** not to be easily disconcerted or alarmed by any spirit or message or letter seeming to be from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has already come.

**³** Let no one deceive you in any way, for it will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness—the son of destruction—is revealed.

**⁴** He will oppose and exalt himself above every so-called god or object of worship. So he will seat himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.

**⁵** Do you not remember that I told you these things while I was still with you?

**⁶** And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.

**⁷** For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who now restrains it will continue until he is taken out of the way.

**⁸** And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and annihilate by the majesty of His arrival.

**⁹** The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the working of Satan, with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder,

**¹⁰** and with every wicked deception directed against those who are perishing, because they refused the love of the truth that would have saved them.

**¹¹** For this reason God will send them a powerful delusion so that they believe the lie,

**¹²** in order that judgment may come upon all who have disbelieved the truth and delighted in wickedness.

## Stand Firm

**¹³** But we should always thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning [^4553] to be saved by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth.

**¹⁴** To this He called you through our gospel, so that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**¹⁵** Therefore, brothers, stand firm and cling to the traditions we taught you, whether by speech or by letter.

**¹⁶** Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who by grace has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope,

**¹⁷** encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.

[^4553]: 2:13 Or God has chosen you as the firstfruits
